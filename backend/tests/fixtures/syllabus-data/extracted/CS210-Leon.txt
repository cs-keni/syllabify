Course Materials
(Required) Python Programming in Context, 3rd ed., Miller and Ranum. Jones and
Bartlett Learning, 2021. You can obtain a hard copy or electronic version using multiple methods.
Note that you will also use this book for part of CIS211. You may acquire it through Duck Store or
Amazon.
(Required) Coding Rooms. Besides Canvas, we will use Coding Rooms
(CR for short) for submitting and grading projects and labs. This tool allows us
to code during office hours and for programming projects. Join CIS 210 W 24
in coding rooms using the join link
(https://app.codingrooms.com/app/?joinCode=C-aHG3G3Y) or join code (C-
aHG3G3Y) and submit the $30 payment as soon as possible at

https://buy.stripe.com/aEUcPN5q8g578jSeVG. Register and pay with your school email address.
(Required) iClicker. I will use quizzes as a proxy for taking roll. To respond to those quizzes,
Download the iClicker app (https://apps.apple.com/us/app/iclicker-student/id899690067). The join
link for this course is (https://join.iclicker.com/SUGH). Do not buy a physical iClicker - you will not
need it for this course!!!
Attendance
I will follow the new course attendance and engagement policy (https://provost.uoregon.edu/course-
attendance-and-engagement-policy). The gist is that it is not up to the instructor's judgment whether
the absence is "excused" or "unexcused."
• If you have a letter from the Accessible Education Center (AEC -
https://aec.uoregon.edu/request-accommodations) stating that you may need to miss class, I
will exempt you from the attendance requirement. If you anticipate needing this
accommodation (or other accommodations), please get a start with AEC immediately and
inform me as soon as possible.
• Absence required for religious observance (https://provost.uoregon.edu/religious-
observance-accommodations-policy) will be excused, but you need to submit a form
(https://registrar.uoregon.edu/sites/registrar1.uoregon.edu/files/pdf/form-religious-
accommodation-request.pdf) before, not after, your absence (and preferably by the second
week in the term).
• Suppose you encounter an emergency that will cause you to miss more than the allowances.
In that case, your options are (a) withdrawing from this course, (b) an incomplete, but only
if it would satisfy UO incompletes policy (https://provost.uoregon.edu/grades-incompletes-
policy), or (c) contacting the Dean of Students to request an emergency academic
notification (https://dos.uoregon.edu/dos-faq).
• Attendance will count for 5% of the total course grade. Read iClicker in Course Materials
above. I will give iClicker quizzes regularly throughout the term, but not every lecture.
Following the lectures is the only way to provide timely interaction with the course instructor.
There will be no lectures in hybrid instruction mode or parallel Zoom meetings for lectures or lab
sessions. This course will not provide any recordings of lectures or lab sessions.
Grading
CIS majors, minors, and DSCI majors must take CIS 210 graded; others may take it graded or P/N.
In this course, you accumulate points as you complete assignments, exams, and other required
activities. The table below shows the point values of each component.

Canvas will automatically drop the lowest grade from Projects and Labs (independently). To calculate
your letter grade, grades will be rounded but not curved. Then, the letter grade will be computed from
your final score according to the following table.
Here is an example of the grade calculation procedure; the following image shows a grade simulator,
with its components explained below.
• Online exams are averaged – (80 + 85.00)/2 = 82.50
• Exams are averaged – (80 + 90.00)/2 = 85.00
• Code Demo and Attendance grades are based on a scale of 100
• Projects – The lowest two project grades (10, 50) will not be considered; the project’s
average is (0+95+100+100+80+90+85)/7 = 90.00
• Labs – Canvas will not consider the lowest two lab grades (50, 10), so the project’s average is
(90+90+70+100+95+90+90)/7 = 89.29
• The final grade after rounding is 82.50 * 0.20 + 85.00 * 0.4 + 85 * 0.05 + 70.00 * 0.05 + 0.90
* 0.02 + 89.29 * 0.10 = 85.00
• The course letter grade will be B

Tips for CS 210 Students
• Come to lectures and participate. Lectures provide a detailed introduction to new material
and examples relevant to the current or upcoming assignments and exams. Do the assigned
reading before lectures. Participation in lectures and laboratories is the reason why you are
paying tuition.
• Monitor your grades in Canvas using the Grades Menu Option. Notify your instructor
of problems or discrepancies without delay. You must deal with any grading issues by e-
mail.
• Come to office hours. Office hours allow you to get one-on-one help, ask questions, and
seek general advice. Work smart and ask for help (sooner rather than later).
• Complete all assignments and submit them on time. Missing projects will have a
significant effect on your final grade. Do not fall behind; start projects early. You will
always get partial credit for partial solutions.
• Inform the instructor ASAP if you are having difficulties. There are often options early
in the course that simply do not exist later.
• E-mail Forwarding. Canvas sends you all of the course notifications to your UO e-mail
address. You can have your UO e-mail automatically forwarded to your primary e-mail
account.
Course Communication
E-mail
Use E-mail for grading clarifications and personal questions.
Canvas
Do not use Canvas Messaging for any course communication. Canvas' messaging system is
impractical from the instructor's point of view. Make sure you understand that Canvas is not E-mail.
Discord Campus Wire
Join Campus Wire, CW, for peer-to-peer communication:
• Course Name: CS 210: Computer Science I
• Invite Link: https://campuswire.com/p/GA0CBDA09 (code: 3986)
Please select the appropriate CW channel for your posts:
• Announcements – This channel is for official announcements only. Let me know if you
want to post an announcement, and I will post it.
• General – Used to post comments, collaboration invitations to your peers, share an exciting
website, tutorial, book, video, etc.
• Office hours – Post all OH-related announcements (from the teaching team) and questions
here.
• Use E-mail for questions about grading clarifications and personal questions.
You may also reply to your peers’ questions. When a student answers a question, anyone in the staff
team can reinforce, complement, or correct the previous answer.

Do not Post Code
Students will undoubtedly need help with specific code. You may post 1-2 lines of code with a
particular question; however, do not post code blocks to Discord unless you post privately to the
instructor or TAs.
Netiquette Policy
Please use appropriate online etiquette to post or respond to any electronic communication. This
course does not tolerate inappropriate forum postings. Below are specific online Netiquette
guidelines:
• Never post personal information about another person.
• You may disagree with someone but never insult another person or use profanity, including
Internet abbreviations known to represent profanity.
• Do not repeatedly post the same content (also known as scrolling).
• Post only material relevant to this course.
• Avoid posting content in ALL CAPS. Avoid emphasis in response to other posters that
indicate derision.
• Try to follow the Golden Rule: treat others as you would like to be treated.
Academic Integrity Policy
The CS 210 Academic Integrity Policy is as follows:
1. Do not share programs/code with other students.
2. Do not submit the work of others, including any code found online, as your own work.
3. Be prepared to explain any program code you submit.
The instructor and the University expect academic honesty; they will handle suspected dishonesty
according to university policy: "academic misconduct … affects our entire university community …
it devalues the reputation of our institution, its faculty, its students, and the degrees we offer.
Moreover, academic misconduct is particularly unfair to the students who do their work with
integrity and honor. All suspected academic misconduct incidents must be reported to the Office of
Student Conduct and Community Standards."
You must credit all online sources you used as references by including a single comment in your
code with the source URL. Referencing online material does not mean you may duplicate the online
material.
You must produce the code you submit for labs and projects. Using ChatGPT or other Generative
Artificial Intelligence tools to create such code is not considered your work. In any case, be
prepared to answer questions about the code you submit.
Cheating means any deception by which a student misrepresents or misleadingly demonstrates that
the student has mastered information on an academic exercise that the student has not learned. See
UO Student Conduct Code – https://policies.uoregon.edu/vol-3-administration-student-affairs/ch-1-
conduct/student-conduct-code. The work you submit must be the result of your engagement with the
process of computational problem-solving. When you turn in the solution to an assignment with
your name on it, you state that you are its author. Academic misconduct (e.g., plagiarism, copying
code, cheating on exams) is a severe violation of the UO student conduct code, and its
consequences can be severe and permanent. Students who cheat in CS 210 will fail the class.

"Ignorantia juris non excusat" – Ignorance of the law is no excuse. A student unaware of important
course information may not escape liability for not meeting deadlines or expectations merely by
being unaware of their content.
Universal Learning Environment
The University of Oregon, the CS department, and I are all working to create inclusive learning
environments. Notify me if aspects of this course's instruction or design hinder your participation.
Students with a UO disability notification letter should meet with me as early as possible. For
Support and Services for Students with Disabilities, see the Accessible Education Center
(http://aec.uoregon.edu/).
University COVID Policies
Read and follow the University of Oregon COVID regulations (https://coronavirus.uoregon.edu/).
Inclement Weather
Class is generally expected to meet unless the University is officially closed for inclement weather. If
it becomes necessary to cancel class while the University remains open, this will be announced on
Canvas and by E-mail. Updates on inclement weather and closure are also communicated in other
ways described here: https://hr.uoregon.edu/about-hr/campus-notifications/inclement-
weather/inclement-weather-immediate-updates.
Reporting Discrimination, Harassment, or Violence
Students experiencing sex or gender-based discrimination, harassment, or violence should call the 24-7
hotline at 541-346-SAFE [7244] or visit safe.uoregon.edu for help. Students experiencing all forms of
prohibited discrimination or harassment may contact the Dean of Students Office at 5411-346-3216 or
the non-confidential Title IX Coordinator/OICRC at 541-346-3123. Additional resources are available
at investigations.uoregon.edu/how-get-support.
Mental Health and Wellness
Life at college can be very complicated. Students often feel overwhelmed or stressed, experience
anxiety or depression, struggle with relationships, or just need help navigating challenges. If you're
facing such challenges, you don't need to handle them alone--there's help and support on campus.
As your instructor, if I believe you may need additional support, I will express my concerns and the
reasons for them and refer you to resources that might be helpful. I do not intend to know the details
of what might be bothering you, but simply to let you know I care and that help is available. Getting
help is a courageous thing to do—for yourself and those you care about.

University Health Services helps students cope with difficult emotions and life stressors. If you
need general resources on coping with stress or want to talk with another student who has been in
the same place as you, visit the Duck Nest (located in the EMU on the ground floor) and get help
from one of the specially trained Peer Wellness Advocates. Find out more at
health.uoregon.edu/ducknest.
University Counseling Services (UCS) has a team of dedicated staff members to support you with
your concerns, many of whom can provide identity-based support. All clinical services are free and
confidential. Find out more at counseling.uoregon.edu or by calling 541-346-3227 (anytime UCS is
closed, the After-Hours Support and Crisis Line is available by calling this same number).
Basic Needs
Any student who has difficulty affording groceries or accessing sufficient food to eat every day or who
lacks a safe and stable place to live and believes this may affect their performance in the course is
urged to contact the Dean of Students Office (346-3216, 164 Oregon Hall) for support. This UO
webpage includes resources for food, housing, healthcare, childcare, transportation, technology,
finances, and legal support: https://blogs.uoregon.edu/basicneeds/food/.
Accommodations for Religious Observances
The University makes reasonable accommodations, upon request, for students who are unable to attend
a class for religious obligations or observance reasons, in accordance with the university
discrimination policy, which says, “Any student who, because of religious beliefs, is unable to attend
classes on a particular day shall be excused from attendance requirements and any examination or
other assignment on that day. The student shall make up the examination or other assignment missed
because of the absence.” To request accommodations for this course for religious observance, visit the
Office of the Registrar's website https://registrar.uoregon.edu/calendars/religious-observances and
complete and submit to the instructor the “Student Religious Accommodation Request” form prior to
the end of the second week of the term.
