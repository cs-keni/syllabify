COURSE ORIENTATION
The objective of MKT 372 (Integrated Marketing Communications) is to provide an overview of
the components and considerations involved in marketing communications strategy decisions.
In order to accomplish this goal, one must first understand the situation from the consumer
perspective (or the recipient of the communication efforts). Thus, the first part of the course will
consider the basic principles underlying consumer information processing and how marketing
communication efforts can influence this process. The second part of the course will focus on
the individual elements of the marketing communications mix (advertising, digital media, social
media, sales promotion, and public relations) and how these elements are combined into an
integrated promotional campaign.
CLASS SESSIONS
We will begin the first two weeks of class in Internet mode via Zoom. The Zoom links for class
will be posted in Canvas. After that time, barring other developments, we will transition to in-
person classroom instruction (CBA 4.324) beginning the week of January 31.
READINGS
Available (either hard copy or electronically) from UT Copy, McCombs School of Business (GSB
3.136) or https://utlinestore.utexas.edu/.
GRADING AND EVALUATION:
There will be a midterm exam and several quizzes covering the material from class and the
readings. Each student will also be required to participate in group mini-project assignments
and a related final group project. You will be assigned early in the course to groups. You are
free to form your own groups, but the final decision will rest with the instructor. In addition, class
participation is considered very important and will involve taking an active part in class

discussion. In particular, it is important to ask insightful questions and provide constructive and
useful feedback during group presentations. The grading breakdown is as follows:
Midterm Exam 35%
Short Quizzes 10%
Group Project 30%
Mini-Group Projects 15%
Class Participation 10%

PROJECT 1: MESSAGE STRATEGY
The goal of this project is to analyze and critically evaluate your proposed message strategy for
your group project in terms of the topics discussed in class. Thus, the group’s task is to
evaluate this strategy in terms of the following questions. Please summarize your analysis in 3
or less typewritten pages. Please provide a summary description of the message strategy (you
do not have to produce the actual ads at this time).
(1) Who is your target market? Why is this market appropriate?
(2) What is the positioning strategy for the product or service? How does this compare to
the major competitors? Why is this an effective positioning strategy? IMPORTANT:
This should consist of one or two words (i.e., OWN A WORD)
(3) How will you generate attention and reception?
(4) What type of decision process is involved for this product/service? Is it central route
(cognitive or affective) or peripheral route (cognitive or affective) processing? How will
you try to influence this decision process?
(5) What type of attitude change or message strategy does this message employ? Why is
it appropriate for the product/service and target market? What are the objectives of this
strategy?
(6) What traditional advertising media (if any) do you plan to employ and why or why not?
This project is due and will be discussed in class on Monday, March 28.

PROJECT 2: DIGITAL AND SOCIAL MEDIA
The goal of this project is to analyze and critically evaluate any digital and social media efforts
as well as direct mail, infomercials, or home shopping networks. You should employ as many of
these tools as you feel necessary but should have at least three. Please evaluate your
proposed efforts in terms of the questions below. Please summarize your analysis in 4 or less
typewritten pages. Also, please provide a brief description of your proposals.
(1) What are the objectives of each effort (i.e., what kind of impact do you think these
efforts will have on consumer information processing and decision making)?
(2) How are the campaigns effective in generating attention and reception?
(3) Are these efforts more likely to generate central route or peripheral route processing
(cognitive or affective)? Is it a good match for the type of product/service and target
market?
(4) What would be some advantages of this these efforts (relative to other
communications)? What would be some disadvantages? How could these be
addressed?
(5) Is the message being portrayed by these efforts consistent with the product/service
message being portrayed in the other communications in the mix? If not, why? How
will these efforts affect the’ image’ of the product/service?
(6) How do the digital/social media marketing efforts compare to what some of the major
competitors are doing? Do they provide the product/service with a competitive
advantage? Why or why not? If not, how can they be improved to do so?
This project is due and will be discussed in class on Monday, April 11.

relations efforts that will be part of your campaign. Thus, the group’s task is to identify which of
the different types of sales promotions you plan to implement for your marketing
communications plan. You should have at least two promotions, but are encouraged to
propose more. In terms of PR, the group’s task is to identify which of the different types of
public relations and publicity you plan to implement for your marketing communications plan.
You should have at least two PR efforts, but are also encouraged to propose more. Evaluate
all of these efforts in terms of the following questions. Please summarize your analysis in 5 or
less typewritten pages. Please also provide a summary description of your promotions and PR
efforts.
(1) What are the objectives of each promotion or PR effort (i.e., what kind of impact will
these communications will have on consumer information processing and decision
making)? How will these objectives will be achieved?
(2) Are these promotions or PR efforts more likely to impact on central route (cognitive or
affective) peripheral route (cognitive or affective) processing and why?
(3) What are the strengths and weaknesses of these promotions or PR efforts?
(4) Is the ’message’ being portrayed by these communications consistent with the
product/service message being portrayed in advertising for the product/service? If not,
how could promotional/PR efforts be altered? How will these communications affect
the’ image’ of the product/service?
(5) How do these promotions or PR efforts compare to what some of the major competitors
are doing? Do they provide the product/service with a competitive advantage? Why or
why not? If not, how can they be improved to do so?
This project is due and will be discussed in class on Wednesday, April 20.

GROUP PROJECT ASSIGNMENT
Overview
The purpose of this assignment is to give students experience in applying course concepts to
the development of an integrated marketing communications campaign. Each group will
develop a marketing communications plan for a product or service of their choosing. We will
develop this plan throughout the semester, first in terms of mini-projects which will address
various subsections of the overall plan. Then, at the end of the semester, each group will make
an oral presentation of their entire campaign to the class. As a part of the presentation, each
group will make a video or storyboard of a proposed television and/or internet campaign and
show the ads to the class. In addition, the group will be required to submit a 17-to-21 page
written report which details the rationale and strategy underlying the campaign. You are
encouraged to use your creativity and have fun with this assignment.
Selection of Project or Service
Each group will be given the flexibility to select a product or service which interests them.
However, two factors must guide the selection of a product or service. First, the group should
select a brand or service which they feel could improve its market position by changing the
marketing communications strategy. In other words, the market leader in a product category
should be avoided. Second, the product or service should be one which normally includes
video (which can be shown on television the internet) as an important part of the campaign.
Each group will be asked to submit a 1 page proposal which discusses the product or service
selected and the general approach which will be taken. This proposal must be submitted at the
beginning of class on Monday, February 7. The instructor reserves the right of final approval
for all projects.
Project Guidelines
Mini- Projects
Rather than having one large project occur at the end of semester, we will develop the plan over
the course of the semester through a series of mini projects. These mini- projects will ask each
group to carefully analyze and develop a strategy for each of the main strategic areas of the
communications plan: Message Strategy (Project 1), Digital and Social Media (Project 2), and
Sales Promotion/ Public Relations (Project 3). During the class periods for these projects, a
subset of the groups will be asked to present their plan as a basis for class discussion. A critical
part of these sessions will involve class members providing useful feedback to the groups
presenting. The quality of the feedback and the usefulness of the questions will be a critical
component of the class participation grade.

Integrated Marketing Communications Plan
At the end of the semester, each group will submit an integrated marketing communications
plan which brings all the key areas together. This plan and written report must address each of
the following areas:
1. Situation Analysis--What are the general dynamics of the industry and market which
have an important influence on your promotional strategy? In particular, what is the
nature of the consumer behavior in the product category and what is the nature of the
competitive situation?
2. Target Market Analysis--How is the target market defined and why? What are the
important characteristics of the target market?
3. Positioning Strategy--What positioning strategy will be employed and why?
(REMEMBER: Own a Word)
4. Message Strategy--What message will be communicated to the consumers and why?
How will this be communicated (i.e., what is your message strategy?)? Also, you should
address the key points from Project 1.
5. Media Strategy--Which media will be employed to get the message across and why?
(REMEMBER!! One of the media must involve a video which can be shown either on
television or on the internet). How will the message be executed in each media? What
levels of reach and frequency do you hope to achieve?
6. Digital Media-- What types of digital (earned) media will you employ as part of your
campaign and why? What are the objectives of these efforts? Also, you should address
the key points from Project 2.
7. Social Media- What types of social media efforts will you employ as part of your
campaign and why? What are the objectives of these efforts? Also, you should address
the key points from Project 2.
8. Sales Promotion--What type of sales promotion will be employed and why (i.e., what are
the objectives)? In general terms, what proportion of the budget will be devoted to sales
promotion relative to advertising and why? Also, you should address the key points from
Project 3.
9. Public Relations—Please indicate any public relations activities you would engage in
and why. Also, you should address the key points from Project 3.
10. Integration- How are your different types of communications integrated to achieve
objectives? How do you plan to influence the different stages of the consumer decision
making process? (NOTE: Be sure to relate your analysis to a key chart which will be
provided in class)

ADDITIONAL NOTE: In terms of providing a formal budget for your plan, it is very difficult (and
beyond the focus of this class) to get exact numbers and costs for all of your activities.
Therefore, I would like to focus more on the creative and strategy aspects of your plan.
Nevertheless, I would like you to suggest a plan that is at least reasonable in terms of budget
constraints (i.e., most companies have a restricted budget so don’t include everything ‘under the
sun.’)
IMPORTANT
In writing each of these sections, it is critical to emphasize the justification for each action
recommended. Grading will be weighted heavily in favor of papers which refer back to or
reference class notes, readings, or any other outside sources. I am more interested in the
reasoning behind the strategy than the actual plan itself.
As mentioned previously, each report should be 17 to 21 double-spaced typewritten pages
(excluding exhibits and figures) and should be handed in prior to the start of the oral
presentation.
Oral Presentations
Each group will make a 25 to 30 minute presentation of their plan to the class on a date which
will be assigned at a later point in time (actual dates are April 25, 27, May 2 and 4). The group
should provide a summary of each of the main points in the written report. In making the
presentation, the use of visual aids (e.g., Powerpoint, handouts, ads, charts, etc.) is highly
recommended. Each group member must have some speaking part in the presentation.
An important part of the presentation is the showing of an integrated marketing communication
campaign developed by the group. The group may select any combination of ad types (e.g.,
television, digital, social media, radio, print, billboard, etc.), but a video which can be shown
either on television or on the internet must be a part of the campaign. The group must develop
at least two video ads as part of the campaign. This is important because companies rarely
produce only one ad; they think in terms of a campaign or series of ads. Note that other types
of ads (e.g., digital, social media, magazine, newspaper, radio, etc.) should be considered as
part of a complete campaign as well. But at least two video ads must be produced.
In producing the video ads, students can use their own video equipment (including Smart
phones). There are also basic video editing capabilities in Windows 10
(
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.howtogeek.com/355524/how-to-use-windows-
and in Quick Time (Apple). It is important to stress that I
10s-hidden-video-editor/amp/)
do not expect professional quality videos. It is the underlying idea that is critical. Rough videos
are perfectly fine. The purpose of this aspect of the assignment is to present information to the
class in an interesting and entertaining way. Further, students must turn in copies of the
videos. It is important to note that I do not expect professional quality advertisements from the
groups.

Copies of all advertisements, social media, digital ads, sales promotion, and public
relations efforts must be turned in at the end of the class period. In other words, please
provide actual examples of things that can be reasonably produced (e.g., video ads, digital ads,
print ads, coupons, social media messages, etc.). Materials that would be difficult to reproduce
(e.g., product placement in a movie or TV show, premium, etc.) can simply be described.
Class Evaluation
The class will anonymously evaluate each group following the presentation. This will provide
important and useful feedback to the group. Oral feedback (i.e., questions and comments)
provided during the class discussion of the presentation is a critical element in the class
participation grade. Also, students in each group will anonymously rate fellow group members
in terms of effort on the project in order to ensure that everyone gets the grade they deserve.

STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES
“Any student with a documented disability (physical or cognitive) who requires academic
accommodations should contact the Services for Students with Disabilities area of the Office of
the Dean of Students at 471- 6259 (voice) or 471- 4641 (TTY for users who are deaf or hard of
hearing) as soon as possible to request an official letter outlining authorized accommodations.”
COURSE ENVIRONMENT
Each student should take personal responsibility for helping create a positive, productive class
environment. In the online classroom environment, this includes refraining from interruptions
and other distractions. Please do your best to get the most out of each class session by
avoiding multi-tasking, checking email, messaging, etc.
Use of personal digital devices (i.e., laptops, tablets, smartphones, etc.) will be allowed in class.
However, use should be limited to activities that support the course’s learning objectives –
taking notes, researching/providing information relevant to class discussions (assuming it does
not take time and attention away from class activities), and accessing class material on Canvas.
It is also critical that all students make an effort to get to know all of their classmates, and that
they help the instructor build a learning community that is fully inclusive and that respects the
perspectives and input of all students.
In order to promote academic integrity and provide a fair environment for all students, all exam
and project requirements will be strictly enforced. Any infractions will be reported to Student
Judicial Services.
