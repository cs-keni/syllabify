Website: http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~scottm/cs371m. Course materials and announcements are
available there.
Computing Facilities:
(cid:120) UTCS Microlabs. PCs and Linux machines are available for assignments in the CS
Department microcomputer lab located on the 1st and 3rd floors of GDC, Dell Hall
(north wing). You are free to work on your own computer if you wish.
Android Device: You are NOT required to have an Android Device. Development can be done
on the Android Emulator. However there is no substitute for testing on a real device. I have
multiple Android dev phones and tablets available for checkout during lab hours.
If you do want to purchase an Android device past students have favored the Google 7" Nexus
tablet.
Software: Android development is done in Java. The Microlab computers in GDC are set up to
do Android programming. If you want to work on your own machine you will need the
following. (all of these are freely available)
(cid:120) Java. I recommend version 7.
(cid:120) Android SDK. I recommend downloading APIs levels 10 through the latest (19 as of
August 2014). Link to instructions on installing the Android SDK.
(cid:120) Android Studio
Class Discussion Tool: I have set up a discussion group for the class on Piazza.

(cid:120) Go to the Piazza web site and join the CS371M Mobile Computing for The University of
Texas at Austin.
(cid:120) I will post class announcements and information to the discussion group.
Schedule: A schedule of lecture topics, reading assignments, and assignment distribution and

(cid:120) Final grades are based on 1000 points. 1025 points available. 25 points of slack.
(cid:120) The final letter grades will be assigned based on your total points. The grading systems
consists of 1000 points. The grade cutoffs are: <600 = F, 600 - 699 = D, 700 - 799 = C,
800 - 899 = B, >= 900 = A. Plusses and minuses (+ and -) will be assigned to scores
within 25 points of the cut offs. So for example total points 875 to 899 earn a B+ and
total points 900 to 924 earn an A-.

(cid:120) Assignments will be available on the class web site or Canvas.
(cid:120) If you are dissatisfied with a grade you receive on an assignment or test, you must
submit your complaint via email, along with supporting evidence or arguments, to me or
the TA within one week of the date the teaching staff first attempted to return the
assignment or test to you.
(cid:120) Late work or work in the wrong format is not accepted and will receive a grade of 0.
Academic Honesty: Taken from the CS department Code of Conduct.
"The University and the Department are committed to preserving the reputation of your degree.
It means a lot to you. In order to guarantee that every degree means what it says it means, we
must enforce a strict policy that guarantees that the work that you turn in is your own and that the
grades you receive measure your personal achievements in your classes:
Every piece of work that you turn in with your name on it must be yours and yours alone unless
explicitly allowed by an instructor in a particular class. Specifically, unless otherwise authorized
by an instructor:
(cid:120) Students may not discuss their work with anyone except the instructor and other members
of the instructional staff (instructor, TA, lab proctor or partner on a pair assignment).
(cid:120) Students may not acquire from any source (e.g., another student or an internet site) a
partial or complete solution to a problem or project that has been assigned.
You are responsible for complying with this policy in two ways:
1. You must not turn in work that is not yours, except as expressly permitted by the
instructor of each course.
2. You must not enable someone else to turn in work that is not theirs. Do not share your
work with anyone else. Make sure that you adequately protect all your files. Even after
you have finished a class, do not share your work or published answers with the students
who come after you. They need to do their work on their own.
The penalty for academic dishonesty will be a course grade of F and a referral of the case to the
Dean of Students. Further penalties, including suspension or expulsion from the university may
be imposed by that office.
One final word: This policy is not intended to discourage students from learning from each other,
nor is it unmindful of the fact that most significant work in computer science and in the
computing industry is done by teams of people working together. But, because of our need to
assign individual grades, we are forced to impose an otherwise artificial requirement for
individual work. In some classes, it is possible to allow and even encourage collaboration in
ways that do not interfere with the instructor's ability to assign grades. In these cases, your
instructor will make clear to you exactly what kinds of collaboration are allowed for that class."

For CS371M I expect you to complete the tutorials on your using the provided code when
given.
For your projects I expect you to do significant work on your own.
You can use class examples and examples from the web, but these must be documented.
To be clear, a significant amount of work on your project must be your own, but it is okay
to incorporate code samples and 3rd party libraries.

Dishonesty
Important Dates for Changing Academic Status and Dropping the Course: Refer to the
Registrar's academic calendar for the deadlines for changes in academic status. Highlights are:
(cid:120) Friday, January 23: Last day of the official add/drop period; after this date, changes in
registration require the approval of the department chair and usually the student’s dean.
(cid:120) Wednesday, February 4: (12th class day) Last day to drop for a possible refund. Last day
to add a course.
(cid:120) Monday, April 6: Last day an undergraduate student may, with the dean’s approval,
withdraw from the University or drop a class (Q drop) except for urgent and
substantiated, nonacademic reasons. Last day a student may change registration in a class
to or from the pass/fail or credit/no credit basis.
(cid:120) After Monday, April 6, students must go to the academic advisors in their college Dean's
office if they wish to drop or withdraw from the class.
(cid:120) To be eligible for an incomplete (UT uses the symbol X to indicate incompletes) you
must have a letter grade of C- or better and a written, verifiable excuse for missing the
last test. This is a necessary but insufficient condition for receiving an incomplete.
Students experiencing significant nonacademic problems (extended health problems or family
emergencies) should contact the CNS Dean’s Office (WCH 1.106, (512) 471-4536) or the Dean
of Student’s Office (http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/emergencyresources.php) for assistance.
See the College of Natural Science Guidelines and Procedures page for more information.

Religious Holidays: By UT Austin policy, you must notify me of your pending absence at least
fourteen days prior to the date of observance of a religious holy day. If you must miss a class, an
examination, a work assignment, or a project in order to observe a religious holy day, you will be
given an opportunity to complete the missed work within a reasonable time after the absence.

Students with Disabilities: students with disabilities may request appropriate academic
accommodations from the Division of Diversity and Community Engagement, Services for
Students with Disabilities, 471-6259, www.utexas.edu/diversity/ddce/ssd/.
Many thanks to Professor Frank McCown of Harding University and Professor David Janzen of
Cal Poly - San Luis Obispo for sharing their Android app development materials with me.
