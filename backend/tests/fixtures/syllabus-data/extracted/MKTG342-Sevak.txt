Participation / Assignments: 

To succeed in this class, you must be involved, offering your comments, questions, feedback, and answers. Your participation in class discussions and activities is essential to your ability to understand and apply the material covered in this course. Hence, attendance is expected, and I strongly encourage all students to participate and engage in class discussions. For all absences, please notify me AND your group prior to missing any class. 

There will be several opportunities for participation, including class discussions about the course material, your own examples and observations as a consumer, and teamwork activities during class time. In addition, throughout the semester, there will be three assignments, for which I will ask you to read certain pages from the textbook and submit 1 or 2-page long summaries about the related pages. You will also be required to participate in two online discussions in CANVAS. 

Group Project: 

Each group (team of three students) is required to submit a marketing research report that includes questionnaire design, sampling, data collection, and data analysis. The written report, due on December 11th (Monday), should be approximately 15 pages (double-spaced), excluding appendix. For every 24 hours your project is late, your team will lose 10% of the project grade. Also, you will be required to submit preliminary report parts as we study the relevant material. I will provide you with additional guidance for each part as we go. The interim submissions will be 20% of the project grade. You will be able to revisit your decisions throughout the semester.

IMPORTANTLY, students are expected to meet with their group, usually at least once per week outside of class time. Students may use specified virtual meeting tool(s) (e.g., Zoom) for collaboration, meetings, presentations, etc.

Group Presentation: 

It is important that you gain experience in making presentations. Thus, you, as a group, will be required to make a presentation about your project (approximately 10 minutes). The presentation does not need to cover all of the material of the written report. Instead, it should present highlights that would be relevant to senior management. Your presentation will be evaluated based on its professionalism and persuasiveness.

Peer Review: 

It is extremely important that you contribute to the successful completion of the group project. The project is a collaborative effort, and each student will have the opportunity to evaluate the performance of the other team members in his/her group immediately after the oral presentations. 

Make-up exams: 

Make-up examinations must be taken within one week of the scheduled exam date. An alternate version may be used for make-up examinations. In the event that the examination is not made up within one week, a zero grade will be recorded for the exam. Providing false information regarding missing of the examination is a violation of academic integrity policy. Students will be prosecuted according to the policy with a requested sanction of XF for the course. Illness, of course, should not be used as an excuse to avoid coursework. False claims of legitimate or unavoidable absence may be considered academic integrity violations under Senate Policy 49-20, AAPP G-9.

Extra Credit: 

Individual extra credit is not available, but extra credit opportunities may be provided to the whole class if needed.  

Student Attendance Policy

Class attendance and evaluation of student performance are to occur in accordance with Academic Administrative Policy E-11. As indicated in this policy, “Class attendance is a critical element of student success and one of the most important ways students learn and understand course materials. Students may need to miss a class meeting to participate in a regularly scheduled university-approved curricular or extracurricular activity or due to unavoidable or other legitimate circumstances (including participation in local, state, and federal governmental elections and religious observances).”

In relation to missing an exam or other evaluative event in class, the policy states, “When an absence or other circumstance covered in such policies results in a student being unable to complete an evaluative event that contributes to the final grade, the student or their representative is expected to inform their instructor, who is expected to provide the student, within reason, the opportunity to complete missed evaluative events. The instructor may require use of the class absence form. Even if the absence meets the expectations of University policies listed above, in some situations, making up missed classes or missed evaluative events may not be possible.”

Additional information regarding missed classes and exams can be located in Academic Administrative Policy E-11: Class Attendance and Evaluation of Student Performance.

The following is quoted directly from the "PSU Faculty Senate Policies for Students" regarding academic integrity and academic dishonesty: "Academic integrity is the pursuit of scholarly activity free from fraud and deception and is an educational objective of this institution. Academic dishonesty includes, but is not limited to, cheating, plagiarizing, fabricating of information or citations, facilitating acts of academic dishonesty by others, having unauthorized possession of examinations, submitting work of another person or work previously used without informing the instructor, or tampering with the academic work of other students."     

All University and Penn State Harrisburg policies regarding academic integrity/academic dishonesty apply to this course and the students enrolled in this course. Refer to the following URL for further details on the academic integrity policy of Penn State Harrisburg http://harrisburg.psu.edu/academics/academic-guidelines-and-policies. Each student in this course is expected to work entirely on her/his own while taking any exam, to complete assignments on her/his own effort without the assistance of others unless directed otherwise by the instructor, and to abide by University and Penn State Harrisburg policies about academic integrity and academic dishonesty. Academic dishonesty can result in an assignment of "F" or "XF" as the final grade for the student. Please be aware that Turnitin may be utilized as a plagiarism detection tool in this course.

DETAILED INFORMATION ABOUT THE GROUP PROJECT

You, as a team of three students, are required to develop a marketing research report. The purpose of this project is to acquaint students with the practical and theoretical aspects of marketing research process. Here are the steps you will need to follow for this project:

1. Form a group of three students. Introduce yourself to your team members and try to find a schedule suitable for all of you to work together. Any disagreement within the group must be reported to me immediately to take corrective action before it is too late. 

Do not forget that each team member is responsible for the whole project. You must work as a team. You may choose to divide topics; but your grade will be affected by how well the parts of the report fit together. Also, the below-described sections are not equal in difficulty or length, so think about it before you allocate tasks to group members.

2. Each group will select an existing product, then will collect data about it and analyze the data for research purposes. You are free to choose your own research topic as long as it is related to marketing (e.g., you can try to see whether consumers are satisfied with an existing product or you can do research on what consumers think about the package, pricing strategy and advertisements of this product, etc.). 

3. You must make sure that a proposal about your topic is submitted on September 12th. Here is the outline for the proposal:

Introduction of the Team

Research Topic

Purpose of Research

Bibliography           

4. Each group will prepare a questionnaire for collecting data. Questionnaires should be submitted on October 12th. We will be collecting data in class on October 19th. The data will be analyzed by using SPSS by November 28th.

5. On December 5th and 7th all groups will present their research projects in class (approximately 15 minutes). Please see the rubric on page 8 for more detailed information on presentations.

6. Finally, a detailed written report about the data collection and the findings of the research must be submitted on December 11th (Monday). Please use the APA (American Psychological Association) style (https://guides.libraries.psu.edu/apaquickguide) and the following outline:
