Scope of the Course
Computing is an integral part of all natural sciences and engineering disciplines. All other disciplines
require some familiarity with computers. This course is designed to teach the fundamentals of
computing and programming to students who wish to minor in Computer Science. In this course we will
cover basic computer architecture and software components. We will learn to program in a high level
language (Python). We will learn problem solving techniques for numerical and scientific problems. We
will study the syntax and special features of Python, develop our own algorithms, and translate them to
computer code. No prior programming experience is required but familiarity with personal computers
will help significantly.
We will be following the book quite closely. Supplemental notes will be available on the web. This
course will be a tutorial introduction to programming. Unlike the traditional lecture format, our classes
will be a venue for solving problems, writing programs, and exchanging ideas. Your attendance to the
classes is mandatory. If you are not there for any lecture you need to send me an e-mail
(mitra@cs.utexas.edu) explaining why.
iClicker
Purchase an iClicker from the University Co-op or the iClicker web site.
Register your iClicker. You must re-register your iClicker even if you already registered in a
previous semester.
You must register your iClicker by providing the following information:
your first name
your last name
your UT EID (student ID)
your iClicker's serial number under the bar code on the back of the device
Make sure you bring your working, registered iClicker to every lecture.
Assignments
You may choose to use your own computer to work on these assignments. If you work on your home
computer, you will have to download and install Python 3 ( www.python.org ) on your home machine.
There is a graphical development environment (IDLE) that comes with Python that you can also install.
However, we prefer that you write your programs in a simple text editor (like Notepad or TextEdit) and
run your programs on the command line.
The only way to learn programming is to program. Doing the programming assignments is crucial to
performing well in class. I strongly recommend that you write programs over and above what is assigned
to you. Assignments will be given almost every week. Each assignment will have a clearly stated due
date and time. Assignments start out being easy but get harder over the semester. If you are having
considerable difficulty with Assignments 2 and/or 3, please see me immediately.
The assignments will require a substantial time commitment over several days (an average of 8 hours
per week should be expected). Be sure to budget sufficient time to complete assignments before the
deadline.
Turn in your assignments on time. This permits grading to start promptly after the submission deadline
so that assignments maybe returned promptly. If you do not finish an assignment by the deadline you
2 of 6 9/3/15, 2:37 PM

http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~mitra/csSpring2015/cs303/syllabus.html
have a maximum of two days to turn your assignment in. However, there is a penalty of 10 points (out of
a 100 points) per day. Your assignment is one day late until the midnight of the day after it is due, two
days late from then until midnight of the second day. You must let the student assistants know if you
submit your assignment late. If you still have not finished your assignment after two days, see me and
discuss your particular situation. We may still accept your assignment (with a late penalty) if you have a
compelling case.
Specific grading criteria vary on each assignment. However, in general, programs that do not run
correctly on the CS Lab configuration will receive no more than 80% of the possible points. Other point
deductions are given for such things as: incorrect results, missing features, bad solution logic, etc. No
matter what configuration of software that you have on your home computer, the assignment that is
turned in must run successfully on the CS Lab configuration in order to be graded. Here is the general
grading critera for programming assignments.
Always make a backup copy of the Python 3 source code (i.e. the .py file) on a removable secondary
storage device (e.g. a flash drive). This will be necessary in cases where your program gets lost, is
corrupted, or if there is some dispute over what was turned in when.
For assigned programs, the source code (.py file) must be turned in. The source code must be a text file
that can be run through a Python 3 interpreter. Word processing files (those created with Microsoft
Word, for example, and ending with .doc extension ) will not be accepted.
If you want us to debug your program, come to us during our office hours with your laptop and we will
go through the program with you. Do NOT just e-mail the program to us for debugging. We will not
respond to e-mails that have full length programs that have to be debugged.
Grade Dispute: You have one week from the date the assignment grade is posted to dispute your grade.
The student assistants will be grading the assignments. Send the student assistants an e-mail and see if
you can resolve your differences. If you cannot resolve your differences, you may send me an e-mail
explaining the situation. We will not entertain any grade disputes after one week.
Assignment Identification: All assignments must be submitted with the proper header, containing your
name (as registered), your unique section number, and the assignment number at the top of the
assignment. The format for the header will be specified in the assignment. That specification will
over-ride any other header specification.
In addition, because assignments are submitted as files to Canvas, they must have the correct file name,
which will be specified in the assignment handout. The file name is case sensitive. You must also ensure
that you turn in the assignment to the correct unique section folder - that is, the section you are currently
registered in. Lost assignments are typically caused by turning in an incorrect file name and/or turning a
file into the wrong section folder. Assignments, which omit the header or are incorrect in any one or
more of these requirements, will have the grade reduced by 5% of the maximum grade.
Tutorial Exercises
There will be tutorial exercises on Live Lab that will be assigned. Instructions on how to access Live
Lab will be posted on the class website. We will also be working on the exercises posted on Coding Bat.
Please create an account on Coding Bat , when we tell you to. Use your first name and middle name as
the first name and your last name with any suffix for the last name on the registration form. Once your

account is created, share your account with UTCS303ESP15@yahoo.com.
Quizzes
We will be having quizzes regularly throughout the semester. The quizzes will be administered at the
beginning of class using iClickers. The quizzes will start after the end of the add / drop period, i.e. after
23 Jan 2015. There are no make-up quizzes. We will drop your lowest two quiz grades. If you miss
more than 6 quizzes you will forfeit all of the quiz points.
Tests
There will be three tests and no final examination. The three tests will be during class periods.
Test 1: Mon, 23 Feb 2015
Test 2: Mon, 06 Apr 2015
Test 3: Fri, 08 May 2015
Make-up tests will be given only for the following reasons. In all cases you must provide some form of
documentation.
Ill health
Family emergency
Official UT conflict
Having three tests on the same day is not official UT conflict! For each test you may bring a
non-programmable calculator.
Questions concerning test grades should be given to me in writing along with your test within the next
class day that the test is handed back. We will not entertain any disputes after that time.
Grades
Your performance in this class will be evaluated using your scores for quizzes, tutorial exercises,
programming assignments, and three tests. The weights of each of these components are listed below.
There are no extra credit projects or assignments to improve your grade.
Quizzes: 10%
Tutorial Exercises: 15%
Programming Assignments: 30%
Three Tests (15% each): 45%
All scores will be entered on Canvas. Check your scores regularly on Canvas to make sure that we have
entered them correctly. Remember the average score as shown on Canvas is not correct. It is not
weighted with weights as shown above.
Study Groups
Please organize yourselves into study groups of ~5 students who will meet once a week to discuss the
course. Typically, you will review the lectures, do the reading, and attempt the homework independently
4 of 6 9/3/15, 2:37 PM

http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~mitra/csSpring2015/cs303/syllabus.html
before your weekly meeting with your study group. Studying for tests together is permitted and
encouraged. You may discuss solutions to problems in simple English but cannot exchange code for any
assignment. If you are unsure about how to work together with your friend in a legal, helpful manner, do
come and talk with us. Remember, it is always ok to "work together" with your professor or TA!
We will be using Piazza for general discussion of class related questions rather than the discussion board
on Canvas. Please do not post solutions to any problems on Piazza.
Academic Misconduct Policy
While you are free to discuss the course material with your classmates and are encouraged to form study
groups for the exams, collaboration on homework or programming assignment is not permitted unless
that assignment has been designated as a pair programming assignment.
Helping a friend understand the intent of a homework or programming assignment specification is
permitted. Students who are not pair programmers and who work together too closely (e.g. design their
solution together) should be aware that this is a form of cheating called COLLUSION and is subject to
academic penalties. Penalties for academic misconduct include a failing grade in this course.
The homework, programs, and exams must be the work of students turning them in. University policy
(see Dean of Students' policies on academic integrity) will be followed strictly. We will be running a
sophisticated program on all submitted assignments to detect plagiarism. If we do detect any cases of
academic dishonesty, we will assign a grade of F to all students involved and refer the cases to the Dean
of Students.
Acts that exceed the bounds defined by the approved collaboration practices will be considered cheating.
Such acts include:
Copying solutions, code, or programs from someone else or giving someone else your solutions,
code, or programs
Participation in a discussion group that develops a solution that everyone copies
Posting your code to homework problems on Piazza or Facebook.
Copying code from the internet (e.g. from Piazza or Facebook or other internet sites)
Employing someone to write the solutions for you on homework assignment problems.
We urge everyone in the class to take appropriate measures for protecting one's work. You should protect
your files, homework solution sheets, etc. as deemed reasonable.
Your Responsibilities in This Class
Your performance in this class will be determined by you! It will require a strong dedication to
learning the material and may require a substantial time commitment to complete the
programming assignments.
You are expected to show up on time for class and stay for the whole lecture.
You are required to have your cell phones off and out of sight at all times during the lecture. You
may not make or receive calls on your cell phone or send or receive text messages during lectures.
You may not use a laptop in class.
You are responsible for all material posted to the web site and sent as email. Ignorance of such
material is no excuse.
