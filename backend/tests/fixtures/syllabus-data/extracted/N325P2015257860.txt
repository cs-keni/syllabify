Course Description:
For nursing majors admitted to the professional sequence. Application of the concepts and
theories necessary to promote and restore health of adults with biological problems; related
physiological and psychological responses. Eight laboratory hours a week for one semester.
This course provides students the opportunity to apply the concepts and processes required to
help individuals of varied ages with the promotion and maintenance of health. Students focus on
the physical, social, psychological, and developmental assessment of adult clients. In addition,
students demonstrate the use of basic psycho-motor nursing skills.

N325P Spring 2015
This course carries the Independent Inquiry flag. Independent Inquiry courses are designed to
engage you in the process of inquiry over the course of a semester, providing you with the
opportunity for independent investigation of a question, problem, or project related to your
major. You should therefore expect a substantial portion of your grade to come from the
independent investigation and presentation of your own work.
Course Objectives: After completion of this course the student will be able to:
1. Use nursing process with selected multicultural adults experiencing alterations in health.
2. Apply selected nursing and non-nursing theories that relate to the nursing care of adults.
3. Demonstrate responsibility and accountability for performing nursing actions.
4. Organize nursing care effectively to meet the needs of adults with health problems.
5. Select and utilize nursing research findings which relate to nursing care of adults.
Teaching/Learning Strategies:
1. Clinical Practicum - Students will be assigned to a long-term care facility for part of the
semester (3 weeks) and a unit of a hospital or a rehabilitation center for the remainder of
the semester. For each weekly experience, they are expected to do a systematic
assessment on each patient using a Client Data Base (CDB) and/or a Disease Concept
Map. See Clinical Evaluation Tool under Nursing Process for how scores on these
documents figure into your final grade. After the long-term care facility experience, the
student will be required to collect data on their assigned patient the day before the clinical
experience. In addition, the student is expected to identify the patient’s actual and
potential nursing diagnoses, plan and provide nursing interventions for such nursing
diagnoses, and evaluate the effectiveness of the nursing interventions.
2. Clinical Conference - Each practicum lab group has a weekly conference. This discussion
time is used to assist students in relating knowledge that they have learned in the Adult
Health I course (N325), Assessment (N224), Aging (N227) and the Clinical Skills course
(N127P) to the actual patients care. Students are expected to actively participate in the
clinical conference.
In the conference, students will be introduced to nursing topics/activities that will further
their understanding of nursing care and provide skills that will be useful in the clinical
setting. These topics will be posted to Canvas. Some topics may require researching the
topic or completing assigned readings prior to the conference. Topics may include, but
are not limited to the following:
• Concepts and Theories (Nursing Process, Gordon’s Functional Patterns, Maslow’s
Hierarchy of Needs, Erickson’s Modeling and Role Modeling, Bandura’s Health
Promotion Model, and ethics in health care).
• Communication skills in nursing (Modeling and Role Modeling, change of shift
report, nursing notes, and therapeutic communication)
• Pathophysiology in the Acute Care Setting (diagnostic tests, labs, EKGs, and disease
processes).
• Special Needs (caring for patients with special needs, i.e. fall prevention, patients
with dysphagia, and caring for peri- and post-operative patients)
• Disease Specific Care (Diabetes Mellitus, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease,
Congestive Heart Failure)
2

N325P Spring 2015
• Quality Nursing Indicators and Metrics (transforming care at the bedside, fall
prevention, infection control, reduction of medication errors, pain management, time
management)
• Critical Thinking and Judgment (Situation, Background, Assessment,
Recommendation- SBAR), assessment situations, vital signs, monitoring changes in
patient status based on expected outcomes).
3. Evidence-Based Nursing Research Project – Another learning strategy used in this course
is to promote evidence-based practice by becoming familiar with how to obtain scientific
data to provide insight into nursing practice issues. Each student will choose a research
question and report findings based on current nursing research. Faculty will supply
students with specific project requirements. See Clinical Evaluation Tool under
Application of Knowledge for how score figures into your final grade.
Grading and Evaluation Policy:
Final course grade will be determined using the six categories on the Clinical Evaluation Tool:
• Technical Competence
• Application of Knowledge
• Accountability
• Management
• Nursing Process
• Interpersonal Skills/Caring
A minimum score of 70% in each of the six categories is necessary in order to receive a passing
grade in the course. Performance criteria and written work will be given consideration in
determination of the final grade. Unwarranted absences from clinical, poor preparation, or poor
performance in other J1 courses (e.g. N127P, N224P) - will prevent the student from meeting the
course objectives and result in a lower grade. For example, failure on the Medication Skills
Check-off in N127P would prevent the student from applying that skill in N325P and therefore
affect the N325P grade.
If the instructor, at any time, observes behaviors which in his/her judgment indicate that a
student is not meeting any of the 3 critical elements (safety, knowledge, or communication), the
student will not receive a passing grade regardless of the behaviors assessed in the clinical
evaluation tool.
3

N325P Spring 2015
Final course grades will be earned according to the following percentage scale:
Letter Grade Numeric Grade Description of Performance
A 90-100 Performs consistently in an outstanding manner
B 80-89 Gives quality nursing care
Overall performance is consistently good, but not outstanding.
May have one or more “A” behaviors
C 70-79 Consistently performs in a safe manner
May exhibit some “B” behaviors
D 60-69 Performs inconsistently and frequently in an unsafe manner
Performance requires step-by-step assistance by instructor
Performance unclear that objectives are being met
F <60 Patterns of behavior demonstrate a consistent inability to
function autonomously or safely in the nursing role
Course Policies and Student Responsibilities
Course Repeat Policy:
A student must earn a grade of at least "C" in each nursing course. A student may repeat a nursing
course only one time. No more than two nursing courses may be repeated. If the student does not
earn a grade of "C" or better the second time he or she takes the course, the student cannot continue
in the School of Nursing. If, while repeating the course, the student drops the course or withdraws
from the university at a time when the student’s performance in the course is considered to be
inferior to that required for a grade of "C", the student may not re-enroll in the course or continue in
the School of Nursing.
Honor Codes:
The profession of nursing has a legacy of public respect and trust. We provide specialized care for
the health needs of individuals and the community with integrity, honesty, compassion, and state of
the art knowledge and skills. Learning and practicing responsible and ethical professional behavior is
a vital part of professional education. The Institutional Rules on Student Services and Activities
given in the General Information Catalog (Chapter 11) and The University of Texas at Austin’s
Honor Code apply to all nursing students:
The core values of The University of Texas at Austin are learning, discovery, freedom, leadership,
individual opportunity, and responsibility. Each member of the University is expected to uphold
these values through integrity, honesty, trust, fairness, and respect toward peers and community.
Additionally, the School of Nursing has its own honor code:
As a student in The University of Texas at Austin’s School of Nursing, I pledge myself to be honest
in all of my student activities including, but not limited to, all of my scholastic work and interactions
with patients, members of the community, faculty, and peers. Furthermore, I will not use any
substance prior to or during my interaction with patients that could alter my judgment or ability to
render safe care: this includes but is not limited to any use of alcohol, illegal drugs, and prescription
or over-the counter drugs that may impair my mental and/or physical abilities required to perform
safe patient care. I will disclose to my instructor any violations of the above standards of conduct.

N325P Spring 2015
Academic and Program Accommodations for Students with Disabilities:
Refer to the General Information for information on Academic and Program Accommodations
for Students with Disabilities or contact the Services for Students with Disabilities office in the
Office of the Dean of Students at 471-6259. The School of Nursing works to ensure that students
who have disabilities have equal access to the University’s programs and services. If you have
any questions about services or accommodations for students with disabilities, please talk with
the faculty member, the Assistant Dean for Undergraduate Programs, or the Assistant Dean for
Student and Clinical Affairs.
Student Conduct Policy:
Students and faculty in The School of Nursing each have responsibility for maintaining an
appropriate learning environment. The faculty has the professional responsibility to treat students
with understanding, dignity and respect and to guide the teaching/learning process. Students are
expected to refrain from verbal and nonverbal behaviors in the classroom and clinical that may
be distracting to others, such as, but not limited to: arriving late or leaving early, side
conversations, text messaging, note passing, surfing the internet or answering e-mail on laptops,
and answering cell phone or pager. Students who persistently engage in behaviors that are
disruptive to the teaching/learning process may be required to leave the setting. For further
information, refer to General Information, Institutional Rules on Student Services and Activities,
Chapter 11: Student Discipline and Conduct.
Scholastic Dishonesty Policy and Professional Integrity:
Refer to the General Information for information on the Scholastic Dishonesty Policy Sec. 11-
802. Scholastic dishonesty includes, but is not limited to cheating, plagiarism, collusion,
falsifying academic records, and misrepresenting facts. The Dean of Students Office records acts
of dishonesty and notifies the School of Nursing of each incident. In addition to all of the
University statements and policies relative to academic dishonesty, the School of Nursing
recognizes the strong link between honesty in academic work and professional integrity. Any act
of academic dishonesty, including fabrication of reports or records of interactions with clients, is
considered incompatible with ethical standards of nursing practice. The School of Nursing does
not admit students who have a record of violations to the professional sequence. Students who
engage in scholastic dishonesty will be subject to dismissal and may jeopardize their eligibility
for licensure as a registered nurse.
Some examples of dishonesty are listed below.
1. "Scholastic dishonesty" includes, but is not limited to, cheating, plagiarism, collusion,
falsifying academic records, and any act designed to give unfair academic advantage to
the student. Examples include, but are not limited to, submission of essentially the same
written assignment for two courses without the prior permission of the instructor,
providing false or misleading information in an effort to receive a postponement or an
extension on a test, quiz, or other assignment or the attempt to commit such acts.
2. "Cheating" includes, but is not limited to discussing the contents of an examination with
another student who will take the examination. Falsifying research data, laboratory
reports, and/or other academic work offered for credit.
5

N325P Spring 2015
3. "Plagiarism" includes, but is not limited to, the appropriation, buying, receiving as a gift,
or obtaining by any means, another's work and the submission of it as one's own
academic work offered for credit. When written work is directly transferred from a
source, the content must be in quotations and the reference cited appropriately.
Use of Class Materials:
The materials used in this class, including, but not limited to, exams, quizzes, and homework
assignments are copyright protected works. Any unauthorized copying of the class materials is a
violation of federal law and may result in disciplinary actions being taken against the student.
Additionally, the sharing of class materials without the specific, express approval of the
instructor may be a violation of the University's Student Honor Code and an act of academic
dishonesty, which could result in further disciplinary action. This includes, among other things,
uploading class materials to websites for the purpose of sharing those materials with other
current or future students.
Compliance Policy:
Students must be compliant for clinical courses one month prior to the first class day. Students
who are not compliant will be dropped from the clinical course on the first class day. Students
may petition to be re-enrolled in the clinical course(s) after completing the compliance
requirements. However, University late fees will apply and students will not be guaranteed their
preferred clinical site or instructor.
SON Drug Screening Policy:
One of the components of compliance requires students to participate in a drug screen to be
completed one month prior to the first day of class in the first semester of a student’s program.
However, it is possible that some agencies will require a repeated screen to be more current. The
School of Nursing will provide students with the procedure to follow to obtain the drug screen.
If a student has a positive drug screen s/he will not be allowed to participate in the clinical
component of the course at the assigned clinical agency or any other clinical agency. The student
will be required to withdraw passing from all clinical courses. The student may continue in
lecture courses if proof is provided that the student is currently receiving treatment. The student
must meet prerequisites and co-requisites of any courses taken. Return to clinical courses is
allowed only with documentation of assessment and completed treatment. The Student Affairs
Office will provide directions for reporting to the Board of Nursing.
The University of Texas at Austin School of Nursing encourages students to assume
responsibility for their personal and professional conduct and to seek assistance for substance
abuse from various campus resources such as the University Student Health Counseling Center.
Attendance:
Regular attendance at all class meetings is expected. Faculty is responsible for implementing an
attendance policy and must notify students of any special attendance requirements.
Punctuality & Late or Missed Work Policy:
Faculty is responsible for implementing a Punctuality & Late or Missed Work Policy.
6

N325P Spring 2015
Religious Holidays:
A student who is absent from a class or examination for the observance of a religious holy day
may complete the work missed within a reasonable time after the absence, if proper notice has
been given. Notice must be given at least 14 days prior to the classes scheduled on dates the
student will be absent. For religious holy days that fall within the first two week of the semester,
notice should be given on the first day of the semester. It must be personally delivered to the
instructor and signed and dated by the instructor, or sent certified mail, return receipt requested.
A student who fails to complete missed work within the time allowed will be subject to the
normal academic penalties. Special regulations of colleges and schools, required by the unique
nature of their programs of study, may be enacted through the normal legislative process and
printed in “The Undergraduate Catalog”. These special regulations may not conflict with
University regulations on class attendance and absence.
Course Attendance Requirements:
Attendance is mandatory at all scheduled clinical sessions (including classes in the Skills Lab,
assigned patient care areas in the agencies, and conferences). The student is responsible for all
material discussed and all announcements made, even if the lab session was missed. Failure to
appear for scheduled clinical practicum sessions and tardiness are viewed as unprofessional
behavior. A student who is absent or tardy will be required to complete an alternate clinical
assignment or make up a clinical day. A student will be dropped from a practicum course or
receive a failing grade for patterns of absences or tardiness.
When absence from the clinical lab precludes sufficient experience and/or time for adequate
evaluation, the lab(s) will be made up at the discretion of the instructor. It is the responsibility of
the student to confer with the instructor and mutually determine if and how make-ups will be
handled. This conference must occur within 48 hours of the missed lab
Course Punctuality Requirements:
If the student is unable to attend or will arrive late, the instructor must be notified prior to the
scheduled starting time or as soon as possible when emergency circumstances arise. If the
instructor cannot be contacted, the student must leave a message with the assigned clinical unit,
including the telephone number where she/he may be contacted. In the event the student has been
unable to speak with the instructor concerning a session scheduled at a community agency, the
agency personnel must also be notified.
Course Assignments:
Assignments are expected no later than the due date. If an assignment must be late, alternate
arrangements must be made with the instructor. Late submission can result in a grade reduction
on that assignment.
Clinical Preparation:
The student is expected to come to the lab with the knowledge/skills necessary to meet the
objectives of the day's experience. It is also expected that the student will come to the lab at a
physical and mental level that will not jeopardize the care given to the resident/client and that
will promote his/her own learning. Failure to demonstrate adequate preparation to perform safe
nursing care will result in the student not being allowed to remain in lab for that session.

N325P Spring 2015
Visiting a Clinical Agency: When at an agency without direct instructor supervision:
1. Wear lab coat and photo ID.
2. Identify yourself and your purpose to the person in charge.
3. Consult with and ask for help from the appropriate person when it is logically indicated.
4. Notify the person in charge that you are leaving.
Medications and Calculations:
As a prerequisite to medication administration in clinical nursing courses, students are required
in their N127 course to pass a medications and calculations test with a grade of at least 90.
Because accurate calculation of drugs is essential to patient safety, students will not be allowed
to give medications in clinical settings until the medication test has been successfully passed.
Failure to demonstrate the required 90% competency on a subsequent medication exam may
result in further remediation and/or failure in the course.
Uniform Policy:
Students wear white uniform tops with the burnt orange longhorn on the collar and the School of
Nursing emblem above the left pocket. The pants are burnt orange scrub bottoms with either an
elasticized or drawstring waist. UT uniforms are available at Co-Op East.
Other notes about uniforms and professional appearance:
1. T-shirts worn under the scrub tops must be plain white: long sleeves for cooler winter
months are OK, as long as they can be pushed up out of the way during certain
procedures and gloving.
2. When making pre-clinical data collection visits to clinical sites, a three-quarter length or
full-length lab coat is required. Lab coats must have the School of Nursing emblem on
the left upper side. Emblems can be purchased at Co-Op East. When a lab coat is worn,
appropriate professional clothing should be worn underneath. Shorts, low cut tops, or t-
shirts with slogans and jeans are NOT considered appropriate. In all clinical settings,
students must project a professional image and clearly be identified as a University of
Texas student nurse (i.e. wearing name badge)
3. A photo identification nametag is required and will be available through the Media
Center on the fifth floor in the School of Nursing. Replacements or additional nametags
will cost $5.00 each.
4. Shoes much be a solid color white, black or brown. The top of the shoe must be
impermeable for safety (no mesh, canvas, or cloth). The shoe also needs to have a back to
it so that the nurse could run or move quickly. You need to be able to clean the shoes.
(athletic shoes are OK as long as they are clean and are solid white, black or brown).
Heels of shoes are not to exceed 2 inches in height. Socks must be solid white, black or
brown. Support hosiery is recommended. Clogs and cloth/canvas shoes are unacceptable.
5. Hair must be worn above the collar at all times when in uniform. If hair is long, it must
be tied back securely or put up in a manner that prevents it from falling below the collar.
Hair must be a natural color (i.e., a shade of black, brown, red, gray, or blonde). You will
need to fasten hair back so that it will not drag over open wounds or get in the way of
sterile fields.
8

N325P Spring 2015
6. Nails must be short enough to allow for deep palpation of the abdomen without leaving
fingernail marks in the client’s skin. Artificial nails and nail polish are not permitted in
clinical settings.
7. A watch with the ability to display the time in seconds is required. Jewelry must be kept
to a minimum. A watch with second hand is necessary. Limit rings to one and it must not
have large stones. Remember that hands will be going into gloves, sliding under
mattresses and giving care. Small stud-type or small hoop earrings are acceptable in
clinical. Large or dangling earrings may get in the way and often attract small children
and disoriented clients to catch hold and pull them through the earlobe.
8. Body piercings, other than earlobe, must not be visible while in clinical settings.
9. Tattoos must not be visible as they detract from a professional image.
10. No perfume, cologne, or heavily scented hair spray may be used.
Minimizing Avoidance Behavior in Clients:
Personal appearance and hygiene is a rather complex subject. However, the sensitivity and
complexity of the subject is even more reason why health professionals should develop a
continuing awareness of the effects appearance and hygiene has upon those for whom services
are being rendered. Appearance and hygiene are a part of our total communication with others.
Some behaviors and some habits of grooming, dress, or personal hygiene might be perfectly
acceptable in certain situations and not in others. Individuals in the helping professions, who
come in close physical contact with clients, need to avoid all habits and behaviors that may even
be potentially offensive to clients whom they serve. Some examples are as follows:
1. Perfume or after-shave lotion that seems exotic to the student may cause an allergic
reaction or nausea in another.
2. Chewing gum, which may be very comforting to the student or one of his/her favorite
habits, may cause avoidance behavior in some clients. It could possibly block effective
communications.
3. Body odor and bad breath, including the smell of tobacco smoke, are almost universally
offensive to others. These are almost guaranteed to produce avoidance behavior by
individuals with whom close physical proximity is necessary, e.g., during a physical
assessment, assisting with hygiene. Since the student may be unaware of or become
insensitive to his/her own body or breathe odors, active methods of odor prevention
should be employed. For example, many nurse practitioners, physicians, and dentists
carry breath fresheners.
4. Long, loose flowing hair, in addition to being contrary to principles of asepsis, may be
annoying to clients, particularly if it dangles near or against them during required
procedures, e.g., during a physical assessment, when administering an intramuscular
injection.
9

N325P Spring 2015
5. Hands are very valuable tools. Their appearance, as well as their true state of cleanliness,
is very important to the client. The nails should be short, clean, and should not extend
over the flesh pad of the finger. They should always be washed thoroughly before and
after examining a client, as well as during an exam if the situation indicates (e.g.,
palpation of moist, scaly skin lesions on the client, or examination of the feet before the
eyes and mouth.)
6. Therefore, as a beginning health professional it is hoped that the student will:
a. Reexamine his/her own personal appearance and hygiene in order to determine
whether improvements or changes are needed.
b. Avoid personal habits and aspects of personal hygiene that may cause avoidance
reactions from clients and/or co-workers.
Infectious Disease Policy:
Students in all clinical courses are asked, but not required, to report any infectious diseases they
are carrying at the time of the clinical placement to supervising faculty and the clinical agency.
The purpose of this request is to give faculty and agencies an opportunity to make reasonable
accommodations for student, staff, and patient needs. Acute illness must be reported promptly to
instructor.
Students Transporting Clients in Their Personal Vehicles:
Students are not permitted to transport clients or family members of clients in their own or other
vehicles at any time. Malpractice liability insurance does not provide coverage should an
accident or other untoward event occur while transporting a client. Students are encouraged to
assist the client to make transportation arrangements with family, friends, neighbors, volunteer
agencies of public transportation resources.
Conduct in the Clinical Setting:
Prior to the first clinical experience, each student must complete the Environment of Care Self-
Study (EOC), Workplace Violence, and HIPAA tutorial on the UTSON website. Additional
forms may be required for students for the E-Mar and Medi-Tech computer systems and for
confidentiality agreements. See Instructor for forms. Students are not permitted leave the clinical
site or assigned area during clinical hours without prior permission from the clinical instructor.

Guide for the Use of Clinical Evaluation Tool
(Used for Mid-Term and Final Evaluations)
Evaluation is designed to assist the student in two ways. First, it facilitates student development
by providing criteria for achievement of objectives and instructor feedback throughout the
learning process. Second, it gauges the extent to which the student has attained the objectives at
the termination of the experience and provides a basis for a grade. You will receive feedback
throughout the semester. You will be formally evaluated at Mid-Term soon after the Long-Term
Care rotation. The final evaluation is at the end of the semester.
Understanding the tool and its use is critical to success in the nursing clinical practicum. Read
the tool thoroughly so that you know the direction your learning experiences and efforts should
take. If, after reading these materials, you have any questions or concerns, be sure to clarify them
with your instructor. The tool is designed to help you know and understand your clinical learning
objectives and the specific criteria used for measurement and evaluation.
Guidelines for Use:
• The evaluation tool includes:
o Clinical behaviors.
o An area for instructor/student comments.
o An area for student and instructor signatures.
o A space for the grade.
• The responsibilities of the instructor are as follows:
o Discuss with the student any aspects of the tool that are confusing or unclear to the
student.
o Assign an evaluation rating (percentage) for each category at the end of a respective
clinical component.
o Clarify the process by which grades will be assigned.
o Give the student the opportunity to review the evaluation ratings assigned. The instructor
will ask the student to sign the tool to verify that the student has seen it.
o Make additional comments as indicated (e.g., to note outstanding strengths).
• The responsibilities of the student are as follows:
o Review the tool carefully. Bring any questions or concerns to the attention of the
instructor.
o Review the evaluation rating as assigned and sign in the space indicated. If the student
disagrees with the rating assigned it is the student's responsibility to discuss areas of
difference with the instructor.
o Be accountable for learning and provide evidence of such learning.
o Participate in clinical assignments carefully to meet as many of the clinical objectives and
criteria as possible.
o Review the tool frequently to watch for deficiencies in learning experiences.
o Complete an objective self-assessment for mid-term and final evaluation. To be
submitted prior to evaluation conference time.
12

N325P Spring 2015
The student’s grade is assigned by adding the percentage scores of the six categories:
1. Technical Competence
2. Application of Knowledge
3. Accountability
4. Management
5. Nursing Process
6. Interpersonal Skills/Caring
A minimum score of 70% in each of the six categories is expected in order to receive a passing
grade in the course. An “A” is reserved for “outstanding” performance in all six categories.
NOTE: Please provide your instructor with any feedback relative to the use of the tool that
would help the instructor help you more effectively. The faculty is here to facilitate your success
in the clinical practicum.
Students should use the clinical evaluation tool to evaluate themselves after their clinical
experiences. Behaviors are rated on a percentage scale. Data regarding the clinical behaviors are
provided by the student to the instructor through written work (e.g. nursing process report, client
concept map, medication information), through verbal discussions, and through performance of
client care. Data may also be provided by clients and nursing staff. The faculty will review
clinical evaluation behaviors with the students at mid-semester and at the end of the semester.

CLINICAL EVALUATION TOOL
STUDENT DATE
FACULTY CLINICAL SITE
The following three criteria are critical elements in the student's evaluation. If the clinical
instructor observes behaviors, which in her/his judgment indicate that the student is not meeting
any one of these three criteria at a passing level, the student will not receive a passing grade,
regardless of the behaviors assessed in the remainder of the tool.
YES NO
1. (Safety) Delivers nursing care which prevents real
or potential personal harm to clients and their families.
2. (Knowledge) Demonstrates having a theoretical
knowledge base necessary for clinical practice.
3. (Communication) Demonstrates the use of
communication skills appropriate for the situation.
Comments:
Students should use the clinical evaluation tool to evaluate themselves after their clinical
experiences. Behaviors are rated on a percentage scale. Data regarding the clinical behaviors are
provided by the student to the instructor through written work (e.g. Nursing Process Report,
Client Concept Map, Medication Information), through verbal discussions, and through
performance of client care. Data may also be provided by clients and nursing staff. The faculty
will review clinical evaluation behaviors with the students at mid-semester and at the end of the
semester.

Guidelines for Clinical Lab
Reporting to your Clinical Site:
You are to report to your assigned unit as instructed at a minimum of 5 minutes before the
beginning of clinical. This will allow you to put your things away and be ready to get report from
the nursing staff or your instructor at the beginning of the clinical. It is your responsibility to
clarify any questions you have at that time. If questions remain, ask the instructor.
Patient Care:
a. Vital Signs: After report, vital signs are taken. This includes BP, temperature, pulse,
respiration and, for some patients, weight. These are to be recorded on graphics sheet or
the appropriate facility form.
b. Assessment of Your Patient: When you take vital signs, this is an opportune time to
assess your patient. You are responsible for assessing the status of ALL tubes and
assuring that all drains are functioning properly. This will include such things as
catheters, drains, and NG tubes.
c. Bathing the Patient: The patient is to be given a bath (unless bath schedule differs) and
the bed changed during the clinical time. If you have any questions about this please ask
the instructor.
d. Changing Bed Linens: Only preoperative or discharged patient's beds will not be
changed. Beds of surgical patients will be changed after the patient goes to surgery.
Recording/Reporting:
Recording your Patient Data:
You will be expected to record on each patient’s record for each day of clinical. Your nursing
notes will be written on a separate piece of paper and reviewed by your instructor prior to your
recording the note in the patient’s chart/record. This is to be done until you are told otherwise.
Leaving the Unit:
Before leaving the unit, you must report to your nurse or your instructor your whereabouts and
expected time of return. This is to ensure that your patient will have full nursing coverage in the
event you are off the unit. Likewise, at the end of the clinical day, it is your responsibility to
report off to the assigned nurse for that patient. At the end of the day, be sure to check the three
recording areas for accuracy/completeness. These are:
(1) the nursing notes,
(2) the graphic/checklist, and
(3) the medication record(s)
Reporting Abnormal Findings:
You are expected to keep your nurse informed immediately of abnormal findings, changes, and
needed follow-ups.
19

Guidelines for Nursing Students Following a Contaminated Needle Stick
or Hazardous Exposure to Blood or Blood Products
The faculty and administration of The University of Texas at Austin School of Nursing endorse
the following “Guidelines for Nursing Students Following a Contaminated Needle Stick or
Hazardous Exposure to Blood or Blood Products While in Clinical Learning Experiences.”
Clinical learning sites include such settings as hospitals, clinics, physicians’ offices, patients’
homes, schools, learning center simulation laboratories, and other settings where students may
learn and apply nursing care/skills.
Students who have been exposed to needle sticks or to potentially infectious blood or blood
products should be evaluated and have treatment initiated within two hours according to
established criteria that conform to federal and state law, CDC standards, and University
procedures.
TREATMENT/MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES:
Upon receiving a contaminated needle stick or exposure to blood or blood products, the student
should:
1. Report incident immediately to clinical faculty member, charge nurse and agency’s
employee health office/occupational health office.
2. Wound should be inspected, cleansed and dressed.
3. Student’s treatment intervention should be provided within 2 hours of the exposure
incident. Treatment may be provided by University Health Services (UHS) - Call the
Nurse Advice line at 475-6877 to arrange appointment within the 2-hour time frame. The
Nurse Advice line is available 24/7. If incident occurs after 5 PM you will be referred to
either the UHS urgent care clinic or an area provider.
Please note that all students are responsible for obtaining their own health insurance and are
responsible for the costs of medical/health care assessment, treatment, and follow-up that is not
covered by the student’s health insurance. Students should be aware of the coverage on their
health insurance policy, as most may not cover the full cost of required medical treatment and
services in the case of a needle stick or hazardous exposure to blood or blood products.
In responding to an incident in which a student experiences a contaminated needle stick or
exposure to hazardous blood or blood products, the faculty will:
1. Confirm with the student that all of the above guidelines have been followed
2. Counsel the student as needed regarding follow-up and the most recent CDC protocols.
3. Complete the School of Nursing’s “Clinical Incident Report” and deliver it to the
Assistant Dean for Student and Clinical Affairs at The University of Texas at Austin.

Nursing Building Evacuation Plan
If you see smoke, see flames, smell something burning, or become aware of another emergency
that may require evacuation of the building, immediately:
1. If possible, ISOLATE the fire or other emergency by closing the door.
2. ACTIVATE the nearest FIRE ALARM PULL STATION.
3. EVACUATE to the PRIMARY or SECONDARY ASSEMBLY AREA.
4. Dial University Police at 911 or Dispatch 471-­‐4441.
DO NOT CALL 911 UNTIL YOU ARE OUTSIDE THE BUILDING.
IF A FIRE ALARM IS ACTIVATED OR IF YOU HAVE RECEIVED AN EVACUATION ORDER:
• In a calm and orderly manner, proceed to evacuate the area and follow the instructions of
the Floor Managers or emergency response personnel. Each floor has two designated floor
managers. Their role is to ensure that everyone on their floor has proceeded to the fire exit
stairs. Occupants in areas 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 are to exit the first level of the southwest
stairwell. Occupants in areas 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 are to exit the first level of the northwest
stairwell. See maps that follow these instructions.
• Do not rush, push or panic.
• Close your office, classroom, or lab door behind you.
• EVACUATE to the designated ASSEMBLY AREAS. If your progress to one of the PRIMARY
assembly areas is impeded, proceed to the other PRIMARY assembly area without either
re-­‐entering the building or attempting to move through any obstruction.
• DO NOT USE ELEVATORS TO EVACUATE. Descend the nearest fire exit stairs in single file
down to the GROUND LEVEL (first floor) and exit the building. Primary fire exit stairs are
located on the southwest and northwest ends of the building.
• If there is someone who requires assistance, please escort them to the STAGING AREA.
• Do not reenter the building unless directed by UTPD, an Austin Fire Department Officer in
charge, or Building Manager.
• Faculty are responsible for informing their students and any guests of these procedures. If
for some reason your class should meet in a classroom that is not your assigned classroom,
you should provide evacuation instructions for that location.
Refer to the floor-­‐specific plans to determine your evacuation route and assembly area.
DO NOT BLOCK ACCESS TO BUILDING FOR EMERGENCY PERSONNEL. Do not exit through the
front door of the building unless you are in the lobby areas outside the central
elevators/stairwell or unless access to one of the other stairwells is blocked. If you are in the
courtyard outside the second floor lobby, you may exit through the glass doors to the east or
west, then out to one of the designated assembly areas.
ASSEMBLY AREAS
From NORTHWEST FIRE STAIR EXIT—proceed to first floor stairwell exit door to outside of
building. DO NOT ENTER FIRST FLOOR HALLWAY AND EXIT THROUGH GLASS DOORS. Primary
assembly area is toward the north bridge.
25

N325P Spring 2015
From SOUTHWEST FIRE STAIR EXIT— proceed to first floor stairwell exit door to outside of
building. DO NOT ENTER FIRST FLOOR HALLWAY AND EXIT THROUGH GLASS DOORS. Primary
assembly area is toward south bridge.
EVACUATION ASSISTANCE
It is expected that faculty and staff will assist those among us who require assistance in case of
evacuation. If you, or a guest or student, require assistance in emergency situations, please
inform the Building Manager of the type of assistance needed based on the following
categories:
• Alarm Notification – occupant has hearing and visual impairments; may be able to easily
navigate stairs but require notification if the alarm has activated. This can be the case if a
person with hearing impairments is working in an office with the door closed.
• Slow Evacuation Capability – occupant can navigate stairs but requires some assistance or
who move at a much slower pace than others.
• Impractical Evacuation Capability – occupants who cannot navigate the exit stairs. To
evacuate the building, this occupant must be carried down or evacuated through an
elevator provided with emergency service.
The names of those provided will be kept in the fire alarm panel for use by emergency
responders.
STAGING AREA
If an occupant needs assistance, please escort them to the area outside the stairwell. If they are
unable to use the stairs, wait until everyone has evacuated the area, move them into the
stairwell, and after evacuating the building, inform your Floor Manager where you left them.
