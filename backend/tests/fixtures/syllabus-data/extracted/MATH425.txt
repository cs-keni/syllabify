University of Oregon Fall 2024
MATH 425/525: Statistical Methods
Instructor: Liliana Pazdan-Siudeja Office: 333E Tykeson Hall
Email: lpazdans@uoregon.edu Office Hours: Tu, W, F 11:00-11:45am
(or by appointment)
Prerequisites: Satisfactory score on the Math Placement Exam
Text and Required Materials:
(1) Text: Introduction to the Practice of Statistics, 9th (or newer) edition, by
Moore/McCabe/Craig. We will (likely) cover chapters 1-10.
(2) Access to Excel (you can check university’s website to get a free access)
https:/service.uoregon.edu/TDClient/2030/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=32786
(3) A Scientific, non-graphing Calculator
Course Description: Critical elements of descriptive and inferential statistics; mea-
sures of center and spread, graphical representation of data, confidence intervals,
hypothesis testing, basic probability distributions. Focus on both theoretical and
practical aspects of statistics.
Learning Objectives: A successful student should be able to succeed at an exam
which focuses on the major objectives and contains a lesser focus on supporting ob-
jectives (in particular, drawing upon these for applied exercises).
Major Objectives − By the end of the course a successful student will be able to
• perform basis descriptive statistical analysis of a categorical and quantitative
variable
• use Normal random variable in various calculations
• recognize different types of random variables and be able to make calculations
for them
• create different types of random samples
• construct confidence intervals for different parameters
• test hypotheses for different parameters
Excel: This class has a computer lab component; on Wednesdays we will have our
laboratories (in 445 MCK). We will use Excel as the software. Excel may not be the
software of choice for every scientist, but it is ubiquitous in the world of business, and
it has an easier learning curve than some other packages (R, SAS, MiniTab). Please
make sure that you will have access to it. You can check university’s website to get a
freeaccesshttps:/service.uoregon.edu/TDClient/2030/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=32786

before the class time. I expect students to come prepared for our lab meetings and
review lab-relevant materials beforehand to fully benefit from our time in a lab.

Assessment and Grades:
Homework in Excel 22%
WebWork 12%
Two Midterms 22 % each
Final Exam 22%
Grades are assigned according to the scale
A 90–100%
B 80–89%
C 70–79%
D 60–69%
F < 60%
Plus and minus grades are awarded to the top and bottom 2 percentage points in
each grade bracket (so 98–100 is A+ and 90–92 is A-).
I reserve the right to apply a course adjustment to grades at the end of the term.
Being active in class, might be taken into the account during establishing grades for
“boundary cases”.
The standards for each level of work:

Homework in Excel Your homework assignments will be using Excel to complete.
They will be submitted as a single Excel file (.xls or .xlsx) with each problem on its
own (labeled) sheet/tab. Homework is to be submitted through the corresponding
assignment on Canvas. When submitting your Excel file the name must be: last
name.first name.xls (or xlsx). Any other format files uploaded will not be graded,
and anything entered in the comment will also be ignored. It will be graded for your
last attempt that was submitted till deadline, meaning anytime you complete some
part of the assignment, you may upload an entirely revision. Excel should be the
only software used for the problems, even when the text indicates otherwise. You
solutions should be self-contained (i.e. with a clear reference to cells in Excel and
using Excel functions). Homework uploaded up to one day after its original deadline
will be graded without penalty. The lowest Excel score will be dropped.
Homework on WebWork:
A part of your homework will be given and collected via WebWork. WebWork is
a free, web browser-based program that maintains and grades a pool of homework
problems that have been selected by your instructor. You will usually have a week for
completing WW assignment, with two extra days of reduced scoring (each problem
done during that time will be worth 75% of its original value). This applies to all but
the “Orientation” set.
The due time of the WeBWorK homework will be posted on the WeBWorK webpage
and will not be posted on Canvas.
The lowest WebWork score will be dropped.

Login Into WebWork:
Use https://uowebwork.uoregon.edu/webwork2/ to access WebWork assignments
for this class. Among many sections you need to access YOURS, for Math 425.You
will need to sign in using your regular UofO email credentials: your DuckID as your
username and your UO email password for password. Once you have logged in, you
can change your password, if you wish.
WebWork Orientation:
The first assignment you should complete in WebWork is called “Orientation”. It
does not involve (much) math, but instead is intended to familiarize you with the
interface of WebWork: how to look at problems, how to preview and enter answers,
and so on. This assignment counts as your first homework assignment. Do it by the
end of Friday night on Week 1 for credit. These are easy points!
Exams:
(1) Midterms: Tuesday of Week 5 and Friday of Week 8
(2) Final Exam: Wednesday, December 11, 2024, 10:15 a.m, location TBA (Week
11)
The final exam will not be administered early. Note, you are expected to make the
given exam times. There are no makeup exams. To accommodate for that, the lowest
exam score (from all three exams) is dropped. This means if you miss an exam due
to illness then than will be your dropped exam. This policy is in place because “life
happens”.
If you miss more than one exam, please note that I will not be able to drop ad-
ditional exams for any reason. All students must be treated equally regardless of
circumstances.
Calculator Policy:
Scientific and graphing calculators are good tools for learning, and some of the
homework problems use them. You are welcome to use calculators on homework.
But no calculators will be allowed on any of the exams in this course (unless stated
otherwise). Students are expected to be able to perform basic arithmetic operations
with fractions and decimals by hand.
Communication: Our class will communicate through our Canvas site. Announce-
ments and emails are archived there and automatically forwarded to your UO email,
and can even reach you by text. Check and adjust your settings under Account →
Notifications. If you contact me with a question, I will try to respond within one
business day. I typically provide feedback on assignments graded by me within one
week.
Student Conduct: I plan to treat every student with respect and, as such, expect
my students to show respect for me and for the class as a whole. Violations of the
student conduct code result in the incident being included on your student conduct
record and can result in a failing grade on any course work related to the violation
or a failing grade in the course. The University of Oregon requires all instances of
cheating be reported, no matter how small. Cheating includes, but is not limited to:

4
• Copying the work of another person (student or otherwise) and submitting it
as your own
• Using any materials except those explicitly approved during a test-taking sit-
uation
• Resubmitting graded work that was altered after being returned
• Cooperating on written work for the course without being explicitly allowed
to do so.
For a list of other descriptions of cheating, see the Student Conduct Code,
dos.uoregon.edu/conduct.
Staying Safe in Classes:
As the University of Oregon continues in-person instruction, instructors and students
play a key role in keeping our community healthy and safe.
Prevention:
The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to the virus. There are
some general precautions the CDC recommends to prevent the spread of respiratory
diseases.
• Stay up to date on your COVID-19 vaccines.
• Wear a face covering that covers both your mouth and nose when indoors
around others.
• Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.
• Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.
• Stay home if you are sick. Do not go to work or class.
• Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.
• Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.

Academic Conduct: The code of student conduct and community standards is at
dos.uoregon.edu/conduct. In this course, it is appropriate to help each other on
homework as long as the work you are submitting is your own and you understand it.
It is not appropriate to help each other on exams, to look at other students exams,
or to bring unauthorized material to exams. The University Student Conduct Code
defines academic misconduct, which includes unauthorized help on assignments and
examinations and the use of sources without acknowledgment. Academic misconduct
is prohibited at UO. I will report misconduct to the Office of Student Conduct and
Community Standard consequences can include failure of the course.
Diversity and Inclusion. The University of Oregon community values diversity
and seeks to foster equity and inclusion in a welcoming, safe, and respectful commu-
nity. In this course, we will uphold these principles by encouraging the exploration,

5
engagement, and expression of distinct perspectives and diverse identities. We will
value each class members experiences and contributions and communicate disagree-
ments respectfully. Please notify me if you feel aspects of the course undermine these
principles in any way.
Learning Environment: The University of Oregon strives for inclusive learn-
ing environments. Please notify me if the instruction or design of this course re-
sults in disability-related barriers to your participation. You are also encouraged
to contact the Accessible Education Center in 164 Oregon Hall at 541-346-1155 or
uoaec@uoregon.edu.

Accessibility:
For those of you who are currently registered with Accessible Education Center for
a documented disability, please present your paperwork to me during the first week
of the term so that we can design a plan for you. Those of you with a disability
(or who might) but are not registered with AEC should contact them as soon as
possible. It is much more likely that measures can be taken to provide adequate
special accommodation if the organization is done through AEC. I have attempted
to provide documents that are accessible. Please let me know if you need additional
accommodations.
Student Conduct:
I plan to treat every student with respect and, as such, expect my students to show
respect for me and for the class as a whole. Violations of the student conduct code
result in the incident being included on your student conduct record and can result
in a failing grade on any course work related to the violation or a failing grade in the
course. The University of Oregon requires all instances of cheating be reported, no
matter how small.
Cheating includes, but is not limited to:
-Looking at another student’s exam during a test
-Copying the work of another person (student or otherwise) and submitting it as your
own
-Using any materials except those explicitly approved during a test-taking situation
-Resubmitting graded work that was altered after being returned
For a list of other descriptions of cheating, see the Student Conduct Code.
Suggestions for Successful Study:
Don’t get behind in your homework, reading, etc.
Participate in class, ask questions, and make use of my office hours.
Make friends with your classmates-you can find out for instance what material was
covered when you missed the class or discuss homework problems with them.
Read ahead in the book. Even reading the first few pages of each lesson will help the
material sink in quicker during lecture and allow you to ask meaningful questions.
Keep all your old homework assignments, midterms, and quizzes - most probably, you
will find them useful when you are studying for future tests.

Community Standards:
The University of Oregon community is dedicated to the advancement of knowledge
and the development of integrity. In order to thrive and excel, this community must
preserve the freedom of thought and expression of all its members. The University of

7
Oregon has a long and illustrious history in the area of academic freedom and freedom
of speech. A culture of respect that honors the rights, safety, dignity and worth of
every individual is essential to preserve such freedom. We affirm our respect for the
rights and well-being of all members.
Expected Classroom Behavior:
Students are expected to behave respectfully toward each other and toward the in-
structor during class time. This includes refraining from using cell phones during
lectures, unless allowed for instructional purposes by your instructor.
Attendance:
Attendance is not required but it is strongly encouraged, as it gives you a chance to
ask questions and clarify any potential confusion.
Academic Disruption. In the event of a campus emergency that disrupts aca-
demic activities, course requirements, deadlines, and grading percentages are subject
to change. Information about changes in this course will be communicated as soon
as possible by email, and on Canvas. If we are not able to meet face-to-face, students
should immediately log onto Canvas and read any announcements and/or access al-
ternative assignments. Students are also expected to continue coursework as outlined
in this syllabus or other instructions on Canvas.
Staying Safe in Classes. As the University of Oregon continues in-person instruc-
tion, instructors and students play a key role in keeping our community healthy and
safe.
