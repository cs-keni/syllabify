OFFICIAL UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS COURSE DESCRIPTION: Principles of
Animal Behavior. An introduction to the study of animal behavior: descriptive analysis
of behavior; physiological basis of behavior; development of behavior; adaptive
significance and evolution of behavior; communication and social behavior. Three lecture
hours and one discussion hour a week for one semester.
Prerequisite: Biology 325 or 325H with a grade of at least C-.
Dr. McClelland’s COURSE DESCRIPTION: EVERYBODY likes animal behavior! (At
least, we all like watching shows on the Animal Planet.) Not everyone realizes, though,
that animal behavior is the result of evolutionary principles, particularly natural and
sexual selection acting on the anatomy and physiology of an animal's body and brain.
The study of animal behavior by humans has also evolved from simple beginnings at the
dawn of human civilization until today’s rigorous examination of behavior in the context
of neuroscience and ecology. This course is designed to put you in the academic shoes of
the researchers behind the "animal planet" shows, as well as challenge you to begin
thinking of the interactions among genetics, endocrinology, motivation, metabolism, life
history, learning, neurobiology, sensory physiology, and other elements that clearly
contribute to the way an animal acts. Animal behavior is fun; it is also a rigorous
science, please be prepared to study. It is especially important that you don’t fall behind
the readings for this course and that you attend each and every lecture and discussion
section.

EXAMS: There will be 3 “in-class” and 1 optional final exams which are a combination
of multiple choice, short answer, essay, matching (etc) with increasing numbers of
questions and point values on each exam. The in-class exams will be worth 75, 100 and
125 points increasing sequentially and the final will be worth 150 points. Every exam is
comprehensive; in other words, the 2nd and 3rd exams will cover recently presented
material as well as material from the beginning of the course in a proportional manner.
Please double check the final exam schedule when it becomes available. Finals will be
taken in the classroom.
NO MAKEUP EXAMS WILL BE GIVEN!!! If you cannot take an in-class exam
regardless of reason, you will be required to take the final.
The plus and minus grading system will be used in this course. Percentage
categories for final letter grades which include exams as well as discussion points and the
semester group research project is according to UT policy. (There is a really good
website from the University of Kansas explaining the derivation of the percentages, etc.,
so if you have questions please check this out: http://web.ku.edu/~utile/plus-
minus_grading.pdf)

If you score within the point categories, you are guaranteed the letter grade and
modifier indicated. I have been known to adjust the grade categories to reflect the overall
performance of the class, but this is not a guarantee. DO NOT COUNT ON A CURVE
RAISING YOUR SCORE AND DO NOT ASK. (I will be keeping track of students who
ask about a curve and there will be negative consequences!) You will have many
opportunities to assess your progress in the course, and if you need help understanding
the material in order to achieve the grade you want, ask immediately.
You are responsible for calculating your own grade and progress. Any perceived
grading discrepancy must be appealed in writing by the end of the next class period after
the tests are returned. No appeal will be considered after that.

ACADEMIC HONESTY: I expect students to behave with integrity. Students found
cheating on exams, (which includes discussing the exams outside of class) plagiarizing or
any other violation will receive a score of 0 on that assignment and will have the incident
reported to the Dean of Students' office.
STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES: You may request appropriate academic
accommodations from the Division of Diversity and Community Engagement. Services
for Students with Disabilities, 471-6259. Http://www.utexas.edu/diversity/ddcc/ssd/
RELIGIOUS HOLIDAYS: By UT Austin policy, you must notify me of your pending
absence at least fourteen days prior to the date of observance of a religious holy day. If
you must miss a class, an examination, a work assignment, or a project in order to
observe a religious holy day, you will be given an opportunity to complete the missed
work within a reasonable time after the absence.
INFORMATION REGARDING EMERGENCY EVACUATION ROUTES AND
EMERGENCY PROCEDURES: Information regarding emergency evacuation routes
and emergency procedures can be found at http://www.utexas.edu/emergency
Occupants of buildings on The University of Texas at Austin campus are required to
evacuate buildings when a fire alarm is activated. Alarm activation or announcement
requires exiting and assembling outside. Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of each
classroom and building you may occupy. Remember that the nearest exit door may not
be the one you used when entering the building. Students requiring assistance in
evacuation shall inform their instructor in writing during the first week of class. In the
event of an evacuation, follow the instruction of faculty or class instructors.
Do not re-enter a building unless given instructions by the following: Austin Fire
Department, The University of Texas at Austin Police Department, or Fire Prevention
Services office.
BEHAVIORAL CONCERNS: The Behavior Concerns Advice Line (BCAL) is 232-
5050
BLACKBOARD: I will make use of "Blackboard" and email. Disable any spam blockers
that would prevent an email from me or the TAs reaching you. Please become familiar
with Blackboard (put it on your "favorites" URL list) and be sure to check it regularly for
announcements, assignments, etc.
DISCUSSION GROUPS: This is a required part of the course.
Unique number Discussion Time Discussion Place
50405 Friday 8:00-9:00 PAR 206
50410 Friday 9:00-10:00 PAR 304
50415 Friday 11:00-12:00 CPE 2.206
50420 Friday 12:00-1:00 ECJ 1.204

The weekly discussion sections are a required part of the course and worth 50 points
total, or 10% of your grade. The discussions are your opportunity to meet in smaller
groups to review and variously discuss the topics mentioned during lecture, practice
animal observation, and discuss the primary research articles assigned each week. Ms.
Guerra is the discussion leader in these groups and is available to answer questions
concerning lecture topics and readings. You can expect simple but required assignments
to accomplish each week. Attendance will be taken at the end of the discussion sections.
There will be reading assignments each week which should be read prior to the
discussion section. Readings will be in pdf format on Blackboard.
One of the goals in this class is to have students recognize the differences between
primary literature, “secondary literature” (the readings from American Scientist) and
textbooks. Thus you will be exposed to all 3 types of scientific literature in this course.
If necessary during the discussion session, the TAs can help you construct study
outlines containing relevant (testable) concepts and important vocabulary words. The
discussion sections prior to the week of an exam will be your chance to review the
material. No other reviews will be scheduled for either the in-class or final exams. Any
issues associated with the final independent research project will be brought up and
discussed during the discussion section.
GRADING IN DISCUSSION SECTION: There are point values associated with the
discussion groups. Ms. Guerra is solely responsible for the assignments and grading in
the discussion section and has therefore prepared a separate syllabus outlining her
expectations for you in this part of the course.
GROUP RESEARCH PROJECT (GRP): You will be required to do animal observations
of at least 3 hours and report your findings in a scientific format. A great deal of the time
in discussions will be focused on the accomplishment of this research project. There will
be due dates throughout the semester for the various parts of the GRP so that no one will
be rushed or overwhelmed at the end of the semester. The GRP assignments and final
grade for the discussion and research projects are at the discretion of the TAs.
You should start thinking of which animals would be convenient and/or fun to
observe (not your pet, something wild) and which behaviors are of interest to you. This
research project will be worth 125 points or 25% of your final grade. There will be due
dates during the semester for written parts of this assignment (with associated point
values), leading up to the final due dates before the last class day. Again, more
information will be forthcoming when you meet in discussion section for the first time.

Although I do not take attendance at the lectures, you are expected to be on time and
attend every lecture. There will be videos shown at intervals throughout the semester
during class; they will not be repeated, but the material in the videos will be included on
the exams.
ADVICE FOR DOING WELL: You are upper division biology students so I’m not
going to instruct you in how to succeed at the University of Texas. You should already
be well aware of the need to come to class ON TIME, study outside of class, complete
the readings BEFORE class, etc., etc. It is easy to think of animal behavior as "fun" and
therefore "easy". This is not necessarily true. Other reminders include: NO CELL
PHONES, do not come early or leave late, do not talk in class, do not read the newspaper,
please pay attention, get help immediately if needed.
