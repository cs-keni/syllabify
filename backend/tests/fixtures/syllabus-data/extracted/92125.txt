exams. Don’t pack up early. Staple homework. Don’t be rude.
Text: (Required) Elementary DEs and BVPs 9th Ed., Boyce and DiPrima. I think you’ll find the
student solutions manual (and such things) to be a waste of money.

Homework Assignments on are on the next page and are subject to change. Due dates are an-
nounced in class and no where else. Late home work will not be accepted, and it hurts to ask.
Homework is due at the beginning of the discussion session. Staple multiple pages and polish your
work; we take points off for missing staples and sloppy or disorganized work.
Overview A differential equation is an equation relating the derivatives of an unknown function
to each other. The goal of this course is to learn various techniques for finding such unknown
functions and using these techniques to solve physical problems. After studying first and second-
orderequations,welookattheLaplacetransformmethodsandthenatpartialdifferentialequations.
Quantitative Reasoning This course carries the Quantitative Reasoning flag. Quantitative Rea-
soningcoursesaredesignedtoequipyouwithskillsthatarenecessaryforunderstandingthetypesof
quantitative arguments you will regularly encounter in your adult and professional life. You should
therefore expect a substantial portion of your grade to come from your use of quantitative skills to
analyze real-world problems.

Assignments:
Work the following problems at the appropriate time, as announced in class. Do not hand in the
“Warm-up Exercises”. Numbers in parens are 8th edition equivalents. (I think.)
