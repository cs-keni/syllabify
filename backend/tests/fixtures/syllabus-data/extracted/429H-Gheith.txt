This class will introduce you to:
* Computer architecture (a computer’s master plan as viewed by software)
* The different parts (processor, memory, I/O)
* How the parts interact
* Representation of programs and data
* Programming I/O devices
* Systems programming (virtual memory, DMA, interrupts, exceptions)
* Computer micro-architecture
* How to build a simple processor
* Technology, circuits, logic
* Performance issues
* Software optimizations
* Instruction-level parallelism (pipelining, superscalar, out-of-order)
* Thread-level parallelism and multi-processors
In the process, you’ll learn a few programming languages:
* C: A reasonable balance between abstraction (hiding details) and
transparency (exposing details).

* Assembly/Machine-language: exposes all the details of the underlying
architecture with a thin layer of abstraction. We will focus on x86 and
MIPS.
* Verilog: a hardware design language used to describe hardware using
logic gates, flip-flops, wires, and transistors
Evaluation
* 2 in-class exams: 40% (Thursday 3/12, Thursday 5/7)
* Programming assignments (~ 12): 40%
* Quizzes (~10) (will drop the lowest two scores): 20%
Grade cutoff guidance: A-/A >= 90%, B-/B/B+ >= 80%, C-/C/C+ >= 70%,
D-/D/D+ >= 60%
Project submission
Projects will be assigned, tracked, and submitted using a system based on
the GIT revision control system. I will teach you enough git basics to get
you going but you’re encouraged to learn about git if you’re not already
familiar with it. Here are some online links:

Late policy
All assignments are due at 11:59pm central time on the due date. An
assignment is considered submitted once it has been pushed to your git
repository on the server.
Late assignments will be graded for 50% of the maximum score. You have
till the last day of class to submit late assignments.
Textbook

David Harris and Sarah Harris, “Digital Design and Computer
Architecture” (Second Edition).
Originality of submitted work: you are required to cite any sources you used in
your work (discussions with colleagues, articles, open source projects, google
search results, etc). All violations or your inability to explain your work will raise a
red flag and will be viewed as suspected plagiarism.
Ask lots of questions and have lots of conversations: Lectures are more
useful when they’re interactive. I encourage you to ask questions and ask for
clarifications but please refrain from side conversations. One conversation at a
time.
University Code of Conduct: The core values of the University of Texas at
Austin are learning, discovery, freedom, leadership, individual opportunity, and
responsibility. Each member of the University is expected to uphold these values
through integrity, honesty, trust, fairness, and respect toward peers and
community.
