Course Mission
Welcome to Supply Chain Management 445! This course takes a detailed look at how firms manage
production and inventory. Knowing how much to order (or produce), when to order (or produce), and
where to put everything are critical skills for supply chain managers. The knowledge you gain from this
course will make you a valuable hiring prospect for many firms. The aim is to (1) discuss the problems
and issues confronting operations managers, (2) provide you with language, concepts, insights and
tools to identify, analyze and solve operations problems as they occur across the organization, and (3)
demonstrate computer based analytical techniques. We will use a combination of theory, simulations,
numerical examples, and practical applications to reinforce above concepts and tools.
Learning Outcomes
When you will successfully complete this course, YOU will:
• Discuss the role and importance of the operations management in organizations (manufacturing as well
as service organizations).
• Apply linear programming, an optimization technique, to production, marketing and financial problems.
• Recognize and apply basic appropriate analytical techniques related to decision making in the areas
such as project management, decision tree approach, and forecasting.
• Compare inventory management models and apply appropriate models to given situations.
• Recognize and analyze the importance of supply chain management to an organization in global
business.
Teaching Philosophy
The course is designed to make learning an enjoyable experience. We will look at real world supply chain
cases to assimilate the intricacies of managing a supply chain. To achieve this, I intend to deviate from the
largely understood traditional means of learning i.e., prolonged lecturing which does little more than
providing information. Instead, I plan to have an interesting mix of learning strategies comprising of
Application Exercises (APEXs), i.e., class exercises, Case Studies, Short Videos, Home Assignments and
Page 1

SCM 445.001 Spring 2025
of course some lecturing. The objective is to provide you an opportunity to become more actively involved
in the learning process. However, you must accept responsibility for your learning and complete all the in-
class and after-class activities sincerely and on time. I encourage you to participate in the class activities
and discussions, as also interact with your peers outside the class. Feel free to visit me in my office* or
wherever we meet on campus to discuss your queries.
Grading & Examination Policy
There will be one mid-term examination and one final examination. A typical exam may include a mix of
objective (multiple choice and T/F), and subjective (computational) questions, based on the material
presented in the class, RATs and assignments. The point’s breakdown for determining final grades is as
follows:
Exam- 40% Project - 20%
Class Participation- 10%
Assignments (includes excel & SAP) - 30% (Penalty for late submissions @10 points per day unless
prior arrangements are made with the instructor). You are expected to look up for HWs, which will be
posted on Canvas (the course management system) under Modules.
Class Participation (10%): A portion of the grade for this course is directly tied to your participation in this
class. Successful participation is defined as consistently adhering to University requirements, as presented
in this syllabus. It also includes engaging in group or other activities during class that solicit your feedback
on the readings or material in the lecture. Class participation, which presupposes attendance, also includes
your involvement in the class discussions (more specifically the quality of your observations and inputs in
leading a class discussion), your performance in APEXs and Case Studies, if any.

Attendance
You are strongly encouraged to attend every class. A large portion of the learning in this course will come
from in-class discussions, and APEXs (class exercises); hence, a missed class is a missed opportunity to
participate in class and to learn from your peers. In the event that you must miss a class, it is your
responsibility to obtain a copy of any materials distributed during your absence and to find out what you
may have missed, including homework’s.
Academic Integrity
Academic dishonesty is not limited to simply cheating on an exam or assignment. The following is quoted
directly from the "PSU Faculty Senate Policies for Students" regarding academic integrity and academic
dishonesty: "Academic integrity is the pursuit of scholarly activity free from fraud and deception and is
an educational objective of this institution. Academic dishonesty includes, but is not limited to, cheating,
plagiarizing, fabricating of information or citations, facilitating acts of academic dishonesty by others,
having unauthorized possession of examinations, submitting work of another person or work previously
used without informing the instructor, or tampering with the academic work of other students."
All University and Penn State Harrisburg policies regarding academic integrity/academic
dishonesty apply to this course and the students enrolled in this course. Refer to the following URL for
further details on the academic integrity policy of Penn State Harrisburg:
http://harrisburg.psu.edu/academics/academic-guidelines- and-policies. Each student in this course is

expected to work entirely on her/his own while taking any exam, to complete assignments on her/his own
effort without the assistance of others unless directed otherwise by the instructor, and to abide by
University and Penn State Harrisburg policies about academic integrity and academic dishonesty.
Academic dishonesty can result in assignment of "F" or "XF" as the final grade for the student. I plan to
use Turnitin (http://turnitin.psu.edu/), a plagiarism detection tool.
Disability Access
Penn State welcomes students with disabilities into the University’s educational programs. Penn State
values diversity and inclusion; we are committed to a climate of mutual respect and full participation. Our
goal is to create learning environments that are usable, equitable, inclusive, and welcoming. Every Penn
State campus has a Student DisAbility Resources office. Student DisAbility Resources at Penn State
Harrisburg is located in SEC 205. Student Disability Resources can be contacted via email at
hbgsdr@psu.edu or by phone at 717-948-6025.
To receive consideration for accommodations, you must contact Student DisAbility Resources (SDR),
participate in an intake interview, provide documentation of your disability, and complete an online
Introductory Questionnaire . Additional information is available on the Disability Services
website (http://harrisburg.psu.edu/disability-services). If the documentation supports requests for
reasonable accommodations, SDR will provide you with an accommodations letter, which you will give to
your professors. You will receive accommodations after you give your accommodations letters to your
professors. You should share your accommodations letters with your professors as early in the semester as
possible. Professors do not provide accommodations retroactively.
Counseling & Psychological Services
Success in college depends heavily on your personal health and wellbeing. Please
recognize that some stress and anxiety is a normal part of life and the college experience, and it can be
compounded by unexpected setbacks or life changes outside the classroom. Penn State Harrisburg has a
number of support options listed in this syllabus.
If you are experiencing issues that feel unmanageable, you reach the point that you have difficulty
concentrating and/or feeling motivated, or have anxiety or feelings of depression that interfere with your
ability to function, you may want to consider talking with someone in CAPS (Counseling and Psychological
Services). We have a range of services to help you navigate issues that are impacting your ability to be
healthy, well, and productive.
You can learn more about the confidential mental health services available on campus by
visiting https://harrisburg.psu.edu/counseling-psychological-services or by calling (717) 948-6025. CAPS
is located on the 2nd floor of the Student Enrichment Center, Suite 205.
You can access crisis services 24/7/365 by calling 1-877-229-6400 or by texting “LIONS” to 741741

Educational Equity
Penn State takes great pride to foster a diverse and inclusive environment for students, faculty, and
staff. Acts of intolerance, discrimination, harassment, and/or incivility due to age, ancestry, color,
disability, gender, national origin, race, religious belief, sexual orientation, or veteran status are not tolerated
and can be reported through Educational Equity at the Report Bias
site: http://equity.psu.edu/reportbias/statement. Penn State’s Code of Conduct can be found at the
following link https://studentaffairs.psu.edu/support-safety-conduct/student-conduct/code-conduct.

Direct all inquiries regarding the nondiscrimination policy to The Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
at Penn State Harrisburg at 717-948-6016, and to Student Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion at 717-948-4381

Mandated Reporting
Penn State is committed to equal access to programs, facilities, admission, and employment for all persons.
It is the policy of the University to maintain an environment free of harassment and free of discrimination
against any person because of age, race, color, ancestry, national origin, religion, creed, service in the
uniformed services (as defined in state and federal law), veteran status, sex, sexual orientation, marital or
family status, pregnancy, pregnancy-related conditions, or physical or mental disability, gender, perceived
gender, gender identity, gender expression, genetic information or political ideas. Discriminatory conduct
and harassment, as well as sexual misconduct and relationship violence, violates the dignity of individuals,
impedes the realization of the University’s educational mission, and will not be tolerated. Gender-based
and sexual harassment, including sexual violence, are forms of gender discrimination in that they deny or
limit an individual's ability to participate in or benefit from University programs or activities. For reporting
resources, and support, please visit titleix.psu.edu.
Penn State strongly encourages all members of the campus community to take appropriate action by
providing support and encouraging those impacted by such incidents to submit a report to the Equity &

may also submit a report online by using the Incident Report Form found here: Office of Sexual Misconduct
Prevention & Response Incident Report Form. If the University Title IX staff receives information about
