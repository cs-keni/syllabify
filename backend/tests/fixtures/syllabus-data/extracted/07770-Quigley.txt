Course overview
What is the secret to Apple’s success?
“It’s in Apple’s DNA that technology alone is not enough – it’s technology married
with liberal arts, married with the humanities that yields us the results that makes
our heart sing.” – Steve Jobs
Journalists have been traditionally afraid of technology. Those in the tech world
have traditionally been afraid of liberal arts. Both have been weary of each other.
That has to change.
In this course, you will work toward building an iPhone app in one semester, with
the goal of having an app accepted in the Apple App Store.
Journalism students: You will dream big, research your ideas, test them, work with
your peers, work with Austin’s vibrant tech community, learn code, learn how to
speak to coders, learn to communicate your ideas, learn design and find your place
in the future of journalism and mobile development. After this course, you will be a
developer.
Computer science students: You will be challenged on the programming. We will be
looking for ambitious ideas that stretch your knowledge and abilities. You will also
learn in a meaningful way how to communicate ideas, learn how to work in a team
environment and learn about the journalism industry, its ethics and tenets.
Everyone in this class will learn what it takes to be a well-­‐rounded developer, not
just a communicator or a programmer.
The class is led by a longtime journalist who worked with developers at the Austin
American-­‐Statesman to create one of the first iPhone apps for a newspaper of its
size. Robert Quigley has also worked closely with the newsroom to bring it into the

digital age as Internet editor and social media editor. Joining him is Jeff Linwood, an
Austin mobile developer and entrepreneur.
The class will culminate with a demo day. Students will show off their creations to a
panel of professionals, students and academics and to the general public.
Objectives
By the end of this course, you will:
* Be able to call yourself a developer who can work in a dynamic team environment
* Know how to pitch a great idea and understand on a deep level what resources it
will take to execute on that idea
* Understand and work within the agile development method
* Understand the vital importance of user interface and user experience
* Understand what type of content works on mobile news platforms
* Know how to intelligently critique mobile content and platforms
* Be able to speak to a programmer and understand the limitations and possibilities
of programming and design (for the journalism students)
* Be able to speak to a content producer and understand the limitations and
possibilities of content (for the computer science students)
* Understand how to communicate complex tech challenges through various
platforms
* Understand the various business models for mobile apps
* Gain the skills needed to execute all phases of building an iPhone app.
Teamwork
Early in the semester, students will be divided into teams. The teams will be a
mixture of computer science and journalism students, and each team will be given
freedom to pursue projects independently with guidance.
The teams will also publish regular blog posts that include photos, video and text
stories about their products on utapps.com and run social media campaigns for their
teams.
Structure of the class
* The student teams will brainstorm, research and pitch their idea to the instructors
for approval.
* Students will then immediately begin researching and wireframing their apps.
* Following the agile development method, there will be four “sprints” through the
semester. At the end of each sprint, the development team will have to show their
work in front of the class.
* There will be blog posts, news stories, video stories and developers’-­‐diary style
posts that each team must produce throughout the semester.
* Each team will have a social media presence that the team will be responsible for
maintaining
* There will be stand-­‐up style demos at the end of each mini sprint. At the end of the

course, there will be a Demo Day on April 26 that all students will be required to
attend. The students will show off their work to academics and professionals from
the journalism and tech worlds. The public will also be invited to attend.
* We will use our class time to typically give short lectures (20 minutes or less) and
spend the rest of the time working on your iPhone projects.
Required reading:
* Apple.com’s developer guide (developer.apple.com/iphone)
Suggested reading:
For advanced students (mainly computer science majors):
* Cownway and Hillegass: “IOS Programming, the Big Nerd Ranch Guide” (3rd ed.)
* Isaacson, Walter: “Steve Jobs: A biography”
* AP Style Guide
* Shore: “The Art of Agile Development” Publisher: O’Reilly
Also required:
1. All students must participate in a Demo Day, tentatively scheduled for May 2.
2. Students will be expected to attend a hackathon on March 12 (event runs from
noon to midnight) at the Austin American-­‐Statesman. Your team will blog about the
experience for a grade.
Assessment/how you’re graded
25 percent: App grade. This is a team grade. Your team will be assessed on the
usability, creativity and execution of your app. As part of this grade, your team will
also be required to turn in plans for sprints, and an initial pitch assignment.
24 percent: Student review of work. Individual grade. Teamwork is central to this
course and to developing an app outside of this course. You are expected to be a
strong teammate, and you will be assessed on your contributions twice during the
semester.
16 percent: End-­‐of-­‐sprint demos. Team grade. At the end of each sprint, you will
stand in front of the class with your team and present your progress and product.
14 percent: Blogging. This is a team grade. Your team is expected to post on
utapps.com at least 14 times during the semester about your product, the process,
or anything related to the mobile development industry.
14 percent: Videos. This is a team grade. Throughout the course of the semester,
you are required to post at least four videos and host them on utapps.com. The
videos should be related to your process and product and will be used during Demo

Day.
7 percent: Social media. This is a team grade. Your product needs a social presence,
and as a team you are expected to use social media to reach out to potential
customers.

*Policy on Scholastic Dishonesty: The University defines academic dishonesty as
cheating, plagiarism, unauthorized collaboration, falsifying academic records, and
any act designed to avoid participating honestly in the learning process. Scholastic
dishonesty also includes, but is not limited to, providing false or misleading

information to receive a postponement or an extension on a test, quiz, or other
assignment, and submission of essentially the same written assignment for two
courses without the prior permission of the instructor. By accepting this syllabus,
you have agreed to these guidelines and must adhere to them. Scholastic dishonesty
damages both the student's learning experience and readiness for the future
demands of a work-­‐career. Students who violate University rules on scholastic
dishonesty are subject to disciplinary penalties, including the possibility of failure in
the course and/or dismissal from the University.

official definition of scholastic dishonesty, see Section 11-­‐802,
Institutional Rules on Student Services and Activities.
