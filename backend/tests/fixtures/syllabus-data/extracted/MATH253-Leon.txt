Homework Practices: Homework Practices will be assigned every week on the WeBWorK and
due on each Saturday at 23:59. For logging into the WeBWorK and getting more information,
please readthelast page ofthissyllabus: “More informationonusing theWebWork”.
Quizzes: In-class quizzes on some Mondays. These will be timed, pencil & paper quizzes given at
the last 20-mins of the class. Quizzes will generally cover material on lecture notes, important
concepts,andformulas learnedin thepreviousweek.
Exams: Two midterms and one final. The midterms will be held in 4th and 8th week, respectively.
For each exam, lecture notes, calculators, and cellphones are NOT allowed. Only one 3x5 inches
note card(Front and back) is permitted. UO ID is needed for each exam. Final exam is fixed. If

you have to miss one of the midterms due to extraordinary circumstances, you must ask for my
permission andschedule amake-up exam in advance.
Grades: Gradeswill beweighted asfollows:
15% 9Homeworks
10% 5Quizzes
18% Midterm 1
22% Midterm 2
35% Final
Thegrading scalegenerallyis: 95-100% A+; 90-94.99% A; 85-89.99%A-; 80-84.99%B+;

Calculator and Electronicdevise policy:
Calculatorsare not allowed onquzzies &exams, butyoucan use forhomework assignments.
Learning Objectives: The eventual goal of this course is to understand and use power series
approximationsoffunctions.Specific goals:
1. Show sequencesdoordon’t convergeusingthe definition ofalimit.
2. Usestandard series convergencetests. Finderror boundsfor partialsums.
3. Estimate sums using the integral test, the alternating test, or the comparison test, depending on
circumstances.
4. Calculate radiusofconvergenceand intervalofconvergence forpower series.
5. Calculate Taylorseries. Represent commontranscendental functionsas powerseries.
6. Use Taylor’s remainder theorem to approximate values of transcendental functions to given
levelsofaccuracy.
7. Give power series solutions to appropriate differential equations. Recognize solutions when
common transcendentalfunctions.
Need Math Helps:
1. Scheduled office hours: Any questions in class and homeworks will be welcome. If you can’t
makemy officehours, emailmeto setupan appointment.
2. Knight Library: Tutoring and Academic Engagement Center (TAEC) provides drop-in math and
writing tutoringonthe4th floor ofKnight library.See https://library.uoregon.edu/tutoring.
Learn Environment and AEC Accommodations: The University of Oregon strives for inclusive
learning environments. Please notify me if the instruction or design of this course results in
disability-related barriers to your participation. You are also encouraged to contact the Accessible
Education Center at uoaec@uoregon.edu. You should also contact me(yge7@uoregon.edu) as soon
as possible if there are any specific accommodations I should know about. For something standard

like an accommodation for extra time on exams, you just need to e-mail me your documentation
from AEC---and remember to book your spot in the Testing Center for the written midterm/final
exam well in advance. For other accommodations, I will do everything I can to facilitate, please do
nothesitate to contact meifyouneed extrahelp.
Academic Conduct: The code of student conduct and community standards is at
https://dos.uoregon.edu/conduct. In this course, it is not appropriate to help each other on exams, to
look at other students exams, or to bring unauthorized material to exams. Any type of academic
dishonestywill not betolerated!

More information on using the WebWork
Showing work:
When working on your assignment you should have scratch paper available and neatly write out your
thought process in solving the problem. While WebWork does not grade you on this process, writing
it out carefully will train you in the skills you need. It will help you track down mistakes, and it will
help us track down mistakes when you ask for our help. If you ask us a question about a homework
problem in office hours, the first thing we will probably do is ask you to show us your work. Also,
remember that on quizzes and exams showing your work will sometimes be required. It is important
topractice thiseachweek whiledoing your homeworkassignments.
Logging in to Webwork: First goto themain login pageat
.
https://uowebwork.uoregon.edu/webwork2
Select the "Math 253-your section". Your username is your DuckID: for instance, if your uoregon
email address is johndoe@uoregon.edu, your DuckID is "johndoe" (without the quotation marks).
Yourpassword isthe sameas yourUOemailpassword.
Getting help:
If you have a question about a homework problem, one excellent resource is the "Email instructor"
button at the bottom of the WebWork screen. Clicking on that and typing a short message about what
you'vetriedontheproblem willhelpme diagnosetheissue you're having.
What you should NOT do: Do not send an email simply saying "What am I doing wrong on this
problem" or "I can't seem to get the right answer on this one." On most homework problems it is
impossible to figure out what you are doing wrong if I only see your answer (which is all WebWork
showsme).
What you SHOULD do: If WebWork tells you your answer is wrong, first go back over your work
and see if you can find the mistakes yourself. If you can't, feel free to email me, and include a
description of how you solved the problem as well as any work you did for intermediate steps. The
moreinformationyougive,themore likely itis youwill getaprompt andhelpful reply.
