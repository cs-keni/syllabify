Course Description. The opening line of the 1967 novel, One Hundred Years of Solitude, by
Gabriel García Márquez, is often invoked as the most perfectly-crafted sentence in
literature: “Many years later, as he faced the firing squad, Colonel Aureliano Buendía was to
remember that distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice.” Of course,
García Márquez composed his novel in Spanish. The sentence you read above was Gregory
Rabassa’s translation of García Márquez’s: “Muchos años después, frente al pelotón de
fusilamiento, el coronel Aureliano Buendía había de recordar aquella tarde remota en que su
padre lo llevó a conocer el hielo.”
One Hundred Years of Solitude, known in Spanish as Cien años de soledad, is an
extraordinary novel in both languages, and the reciprocal relationship it inscribes between
Hispanophone and Anglophone societies and cultures on the American continents is part of
its significance to the world of literature. In this introductory comparative literature
course, we will consider the novel in its literary, historical, cultural and political contexts.
And we will read and discuss as a work of “aesthesis,” the practice of encoding abstract
ideas in material form. One Hundred Years of Solitude is known for its particular narrative
technique, which plays games with time, and for the device of “magical realism.” In this
class we practice “close reading” in order to identify how magical realism works, and how it
transforms the concepts of history and literature to reveal dimensions of American
experience that are sometimes masked in more conventional and straightforward
narrative. We will also examine the novel in key twentieth-century aesthetic contexts:
Modernism, surrealism, the avant-garde.
COLT 101 is conducted in English; however, students are warmly encouraged to
work in Spanish and/or in additional languages if they would prefer (including Spanglish).
Please consult with me about your preferences. This course uses a labor-based grading
contract to calculate course grades. There is flexibility in the amount of work a student
invests in this course, and there is no final exam. But it is absolutely crucial to keep up with
the weekly work; after that, you can evaluate whether you want to take on additional tasks
or extended projects. All respect and support given at each level of commitment. I will
explain further details of the contract in Week 1.
Course objectives:
—Students will become familiar with the concept of “aesthesis,” which is the human
practice of giving material form to abstract ideas. Aesthesis is the basis for aesthetic works:
visual, verbal, haptic and media art.
1 COLT 101 2023 – 100 YS / Aesthesis
STUDENT SYLLABUS

—Students will read Gabriel García Márquez’s famed novel, One Hundred Years of Solitude,
and learn to engage with it analytically. This means that we will examine the novel (1) as a
work of aesthesis; (2) as a novel (that is, as a particular kind of art —art made of words);
and (3) as a work of “world literature.”
—The kind of analysis referred to above is known as “close-reading,” and it is the basic
methodology we employ in the discipline of comparative literature. Students in this course
will develop skills in “close-reading,” the practice of reading, analysis and contextualization.
—Students will learn about the literary concepts of “trope,” “allegory,” and “magical
realism;” and, subsequently, how to use those concepts to think critically about the
concepts of history, reason and truth.
—Students will develop a sense of “critique” and deploy it to think and write about the
concepts of “America,” “Latin America,” and modernity.
Course Requirements include:
—Reading the novel, One Hundred Years of Solitude (because of our emphasis on formal
analysis, in this course it is necessary to have a hard copy of the novel and to read it as
assigned; students may read it in the preferred language)
—Active engagement with 6-8 weekly quizzes, due each week by 11:59 p.m. on Mondays
—Active engagement with lectures and presentations, as demonstrated in class and via
“class reflection” assignments (“class reflection” assignments are due in section Canvas)
—Active engagement in section meetings and breakout room "discussion" time
—Slide – “aesthesis” – Due in course Canvas Due October 16, 11:59 p.m.
—1 short close-reading assignment (300-500 words) Due November 6, 11:59 p.m.
—1 optional short written assignment (300 – 500 words) Due either Monday Oct. 30 or
Monday Nov. 20, 11:59 p.m.
—1 optional final project of either a longer critical essay (7-8 pages) or a creative piece (we
will discuss optional final projects later on in the course). This project will be due on
Tuesday of finals week, December 4, 11:59 p.m., in Canvas.
—No final exam
Course Materials. Each student must have a physical copy of One Hundred Years of
Solitude, by Gabriel Garcia Márquez, translated by Gregory Rabassa (NY: Harper Perennial
Modern Classics. 2006). Students are welcome to read the novel in any language they
prefer, but at times we will be considering the career of this novel as it was produced and
circulated in English, so you should have the Rabassa translation handy.
Note that it is very important that we use the Rabassa translation, since Rabassa’s
version of the novel catapulted it to fame in the Anglophone world (and from there, into
“world literature”).
Additional readings can be found in the weekly Course Modules in Canvas.
Course Logistics. Please read carefully.
COLT 102 is an introductory course that fulfills two functions here at the University of
Oregon. As an introductory humanities course, it satisfies UO requirements in Arts and
Letters and in Core Ed/Global Perspectives. As a 100-level Comparative Literature
course, it introduces students to the discipline of Comparative Literature, a set of
2 COLT 101 2023 – 100 YS / Aesthesis
STUDENT SYLLABUS

reading practices and creative, analytical engagements with literature and culture —
in particular, the practice of “close reading”— that I, your instructor, really love. I hope
this course shows you why.
Because students come to COLT 102 with different objectives and needs, I offer
three work plans for the course. These plans involve successively greater investments of
time and labor, so you can work at the level that makes the most sense to you.
You will find more information on these plans, including a checklist so you can keep
track of essential tasks, starting on p. 10 of this syllabus.
No matter which plan you choose, count on our full attention as we engage
with your work. We request that you put your best effort into each assignment or
project; and we will put our best efforts into providing you meaningful feedback, with
an emphasis on what was successful and what to reconsider or try to develop a bit more
the next time. Please note that in this course, written feedback is the start of a conversation.
The very best way to make use of feedback is to come discuss your work with your GE or
with me during our scheduled office hours (or by appointment, if you have schedule
conflicts with our office hours). More information and a checklist for our three work
plans can be found at the end of this syllabus.
All sources used to prepare work for this course must be documented. The use of AI
to prepare work for this course is strictly prohibited and may lead to sanctions
including failing the course. Please see Middlebrook with any questions.

Course policies
Communication.
• The best way to communicate with Middlebrook is to talk with me after class or come to
office hours. I’ll be glad to chat!
• Electronic communication about this course should take place in Canvas. I will do my very
best to respond to student questions within 48 hours of receiving your message. If you have
not heard back from me regarding your message after 48 hours, please reach out to me
again.
• Look carefully at the syllabus before writing us on email. Make sure the information you are
requesting isn’t answered there.
• To the extent you are comfortable and able, please consult with me regarding circumstances
and problems as they arise. Timely notification will help me work with you to find a
solution.
Attendance. Though attendance and participation are a standard expectation on all 3 work plans
for COLT 102, students are allowed up to 5 absences from lecture.
• These absences may be taken for any reason.
• I strongly recommend coming to office hours to discuss what was missed in class, or
meeting with your GE.
6 COLT 101 2023 – 100 YS / Aesthesis
STUDENT SYLLABUS

• If you would like to receive any worksheets or materials distributed in class during a day on
which you were absent, please contact me within 24 hours of the missed class.
Makeup assignments. If you miss more than five classes, and/or if you miss a quiz that has an
impact on your successful completion of your chosen work plan, makeup assignments are available.
Please contact me so we can work out a solution.
Working environment. Please participate by sharing ideas and contributing to the collective
learning environment.
• “Participation” entails preparing as assigned (the quizzes are your friend!), following
instructions, and engaging respectfully and thoughtfully with others.
• I welcome and in fact expect vigorous engagement and a diversity of perspectives, voices
and opinions. There is a lot to talk about in this novel, and García Márquez directs us to
think about challenging issues, from settler colonialism to social privilege and
disempowerment, to family dynamics, including the power relations worked out in
sexuality.
• As we explore these issues and how and why García Márquez represents them in his
novel, it is essential that we maintain a commitment to our ethical, inclusive,
respectful and productive learning environment.
• I welcome questions or concerns regarding the environment in this class.
• I also welcome your feedback if something is handled in a manner that feels
insensitive or naïve (I, too, am learning to navigate this important moment in our
culture.
• Intolerant and/or harassing language and/or behavior in- or outside of our Zoom space and
class meetings is unacceptable and will lead to immediate and serious sanctions.
Protocols for submission of work. Barring a specific need for adjustment, graded work and
weekly quizzes are always due in this course on Mondays at 11:59pm. I hope this regular deadline
simplifies what you need to keep in mind about the routine of the course.
• Weekly quizzes. The weekly quiz is fundamental to supporting your success in this
course. It helps you stay on track with the readings and concepts of the course, and it sets
the stage for the work we will do together in class over the coming week. The best way to
use the quiz is to print it out and have it with you as you prepare the readings for the
week. That way, you’ll know what to be looking for as you navigate García Márquez’s lively,
highly aesthetic, prose. If you’d like, you can take the quiz as you work on the reading. Or
you can take it afterward. However you decide to work, quizzes are due no later than
Monday night at 11:59 pm.
Do everything you can to not miss a quiz. If you do miss one, contact me right away
so we can schedule a makeup. Note that the number of quizzes necessary to receive a
particular grade is specified in the work plans detailed below. But the weekly quizzes help
you organize the long readings and prepare yourself to engage in class. So they are all
recommended.
• Contacting us is your responsibility.
• Documentation of sources. All work must be properly documented using Chicago style.
Here’s a guide, courtesy of the generous folks at Purdue:

Note that the rule about documentation applies to any source (ideas, quotations,
paraphrases, e-notes and study guides, etc.). Failure to document all sources used to
prepare work handed in for this course may lead to sanctions, including failing the course.
• Academic Integrity. All work submitted in this course must be your own and must be
written exclusively for Comparative Literature 101, F 2023. The use of AI to help you
prepare written work for this course is prohibited. I will explain why in Week 1. Please refer
to the Code of Student Conduct on the website for the Office of Student Conduct and
Community Standards for a definition of plagiarism. The Comparative Literature
Department complies with all university policies regarding the reporting, investigation and
sanctioning of academic dishonesty.

Incompletes. Incompletes are strongly discouraged and are only approved in cases of genuine
emergency. You must contact me to begin the process of filing for an Incomplete as soon as you
realize that completing the class may be an issue. Note that your GE does not have the authority
to grant Incompletes; they must be approved by the Instructor of Record (me = Middlebrook).
Accessibility. The Comparative Literature Department and I are committed to the creation of
inclusive learning environments. Please review the syllabus and notify me in Week 1 about
technological issues and ability-related barriers to your participation. You may also wish to contact
the Accessible Education Center in 164 Oregon Hall at 541-346-1155 or uoaec@uoregon.edu for
assistance.
Content Warning. One Hundred Years of Solitude sets the Buendía family at the center of a complex
meditation on Latin American history. One of García Márquez’s primary aims in the novel is to
explore the ambivalent role played by social and political elites in that history. This means that
readers of the novel encounter a number of troubling themes. Incest serves as a metaphor for
the inbred nature of the bourgeoisie, the elite social group García Márquez analyzes. It appears
frequently in the novel, and we are going to need to talk about that. The novel also portrays social
elitism, violence, war, massacre, rape, madness, prejudice and hate speech, eating disorders,
suicide. The Buendía family engages in settler colonialism and various kinds of dispossession; there
is a love plot woven around the relationship of an older man and a pubescent girl, and that love plot
recurs in a way that’s significant to the text. Again: we’ll need to discuss this troubling episode.
I will do my best to provide content warnings in our class (see CW in the Weekly Overviews
in Canvas). I will also guide us toward discovering how many of these themes contribute to a
project of critique: García Márquez, who was a committed socialist, was telling his readers to look
at the inevitable corruption of the elite, 20th-century bourgeoisie, his society’s dominant caste. One
way of thinking about some of the difficult material in this novel is to recognize that it is
fundamental to the work of aesthesis GGM carries out here. However, these can be hard times to
read troubling, deeply stirring works. There is a good deal to discover in this book —it’s a rich and
powerful narrative. There are also reasons to leave it for another time. Before the end of Week 1,
please consider whether you would like to spend the term with this novel. If you would like
an overview, Wikipedia provides a good one here.
If you have questions, please contact me. I will be happy to talk them over.
If you would like to discuss any of the policies described above, I am happy to do so. Please come to my
office hours or make an appointment.

We respect the many demands on your time and attention. Whichever plan you choose, count on
our respect for your efforts and our full engagement with your work. On your side: please
give the work you prepare for this course your best and most thoughtful effort.
Work Plan 1 – A thorough reading of One Hundred Years of Solitude
An introduction to the skills of close-reading and analysis, anchored in our collective read of One
Hundred Years of Solitude.
Students who complete all tasks for Plan 1 are guaranteed a grade of C+ in the course.
Student Engagement Inventory.
Expect to spend somewhere around 5 hours preparing for the classes for the week. Place
emphasis on completing the readings, using the weekly quiz as your guide to what to
look for. Don’t forget to take (and pass) those quizzes, since they are the backbone of the
course. Fun fact: this change in emphasis actually supports the learning goals of the course,
since a key course objective is to train students in the practice of close-reading and analysis of
aesthetic writing (literature).
Students are expected to devote roughly 120 hours to a 4-credit course. Here is a rough
estimate of how that commitment might play out for Work Plan 1:

3 hours in class x 10 weeks = 30 hours
1 hour in section x 10 weeks = 10 hours
Office hour consultations w IOR and GE = 1-5 hours
Projects and longer assignments (see below) = 10-25 hours

Work Plan 2
In this plan, students expand on the basic skills introduced in COLT 102 by incorporating a bit of
critical writing on one of the key aesthetic techniques deployed in the novel: magical realism or
play with the concept of temporality. Both of these concepts will be explored in class. In this
work plan, you commit to not only working on these ideas in class, but also preparing a short
project of critical writing about the theme.
Students who complete all tasks for Plan 2 are guaranteed a grade of B in the course.
