Fourier Optics EE383P
COURSE INFORMATION
Class meets T Th 2:00 – 3:30 pm GDC 5.304
Prerequisite: Working understanding of Signals and Systems (especially Fourier Transforms), or
consent of the Instructor.
Course Description: Fourier optics is the study of how concepts from linear and space-invariant
systems can provide powerful descriptors of how optical waves propagate. The Fourier transform is
one such powerful descriptor, and is of great utility in decomposing electric fields into their harmonic
plane-wave components. This enables rigorous understanding of how light propagates within
instruments composed of linear optical elements, such as is the case with microscopes, telescopes,
and cameras. Fourier optics also introduces a coherent-analysis framework, which enables rich
analysis and understanding of illumination sources ranging from modulated lasers to incoherent white-
light sources. Light coherence also has applications for optical information processing and holography.
Lastly, Fourier Optics also presents a theoretical foundation for diffraction theory, which allows one to
calculate and predict imaging resolution and other interference-based phenomena.

Instructor: Prof. Shwetadwip Chowdhury: shwetadwip.chowdhury@utexas.edu
Teaching Assistant: TBD
Office Hours: Tuesday, 10:00-11:30 in EER 5.808
Textbook: Joseph W. Goodman, Introduction to Fourier Optics 4th ed., MacMillan Learning, 2017
Course work: All students will do a class project in teams of two-three students involving a simulation
of an optical system employing topics from Fourier optics. The one project report per team will be a
paged-limited memo type report, and both team members will receive the same grade.
Homework: Consists mostly of problems from Goodman book. Generally due on the first lecture after
the set of lectures covering the relevant content. Late homework is worth 2/3 when turned in one class
late, 1/3 when a week late, and zero thereafter.
Grading:
1. 2 exams. 25% ea.
2. Homework problem assignments. 25% in total
3. Group project, simulation using computational techniques and report on results (due on last
day of class). 25%
Scholastic Dishonesty:
UT policy will be followed. This is not intended to tell you that it won't be tolerated (it won't), but to tell
you what is permissible and what is not.

Homework: conferring with others is allowed, but what you submit must be your own work (not copied).
For the project, one common version is submitted. What you submit must be the team's own work,
programs, results, etc., or it must be referenced properly. If it's not referenced, and it's not yours, then
it is plagiarism. I do encourage consulting all sources that you can (including your uncle at IBM) so
long as those sources are acknowledged. Be careful to cite web sources completely as well.
Exams: Note sheets and programmable calculators are allowed for the exams. Any exchange of
information (one-way or two-way) outside of you, your note sheet, and your calculator during the exam
is obviously NOT OK. Prior knowledge of exam questions is also NOT OK.
