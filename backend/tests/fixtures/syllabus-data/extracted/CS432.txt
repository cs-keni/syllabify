9 Student Workload
The workload of this course is expected to be as follows.
• Class participation.
– Students should actively participate in the class including raising questions and being involved in
discussions. A pop quiz may be given at the beginning or toward the end of the class.
• Course review and homework. Studentsshouldcarefullyreviewtheclassmaterialsaftertheclass.
There will be 5 homework throughout the term.
• Programming assignment. The class will have a moderate amount of programming assignment.
The student will be allowed to use a language they are familiar with to write their programs, but they
must compile and run in the specified testing environment.
• Paper Reviews (CS 532 only). Students in 532 will need to read 3-5 papers on networking and
write a review about each of them. A template will be given for your review.
• Tests and Exams. There will be three tests throughout the term and one final exam.

10 Course Policies
Outside Classroom Communication
We will use Canvas to post course materials, post and collect assignments, and support discussions. We
encourageeveryonetogetintouchwiththeprofessorandteachingGEofthisclasswhenyouhavequestions.
Do not postpone your questions until the last couple weeks of the term. You should fully exploit the office
hours!
Your email subject should begin with CS 432: or CS 532: to help email filtering.
GenAI Use
StudentsmayNOTuseGenAItoolstoproducehomeworkassignments,paperreviews,orprogramsinwhole
or in part.
Students may use GenAI tools to help debug their programs, revise their paper reviews. In this case,
students can also provide their work prior to AI to receive extra credits.
Students may use GenAI as a private tutor to help them review course materials.
Barriers and Accommodations
Our goal is a fully inclusive class, accessible to everyone. If you encounter or anticipate barriers to full
participation and fair evaluation for any reason, please communicate your needs to the instructor so that we
can find a suitable accommodation. If you encounter or observe other impediments to full participation, for
yourself or others, please share your concerns with the instructor. You are also encouraged to contact the
Accessible Education Center in 360 Oregon Hall at 541-346-1155 or uoaec@uoregon.edu. It is particularly
important that you inform the instructor in the first week of the quarter if you require accommodation.
Academic Honesty
The University Student Conduct Code (available at conduct.uoregon.edu) defines academic misconduct.
Students are prohibited from committing or attempting to commit any act that constitutes academic mis-
conduct. Students should properly acknowledge and document all sources of information (e.g., quotations,
paraphrases, ideas) and use only the sources and resources authorized by the instructor. If there is any
question about whether an act constitutes academic misconduct, it is the student’s obligation to clarify the
question with the instructor before committing to attempting to commit the act.
All work turned in for the course must be your own work. Copying from other class members or other
sources (except for provided materials) is not acceptable. If you collaborate with someone else on an as-
signment, you must indicate such on the work you turn in. Collaboration that is not explicitly credited is
plagiarism.
Academic honesty is expected and cases of suspected dishonesty will be handled according to university
policy. Inparticular,copyingsomeoneelse’swork(includingmaterialfoundontheweb)willnotbetolerated.
If solutions to assignments are obtained from outside sources, the source must be cited.
You are also responsible for protecting your work. That is, you must take reasonable precautions to
prevent your work from being copied. This means that if you store your assignment solutions on a shared
server, the file permissions must be set to keep others from accessing your files. If you are working on
assignments on a shared machine, you must remove any of your files from the machine before you leave.
Turning in someone else’s code is collusion, and is a particularly heinous form of plagiarism; if collusion
is detected, all individuals involved (i.e., the copyee and all copyers) will be given a grade of F in the course.
Academic Disruption due to Campus Emergency
In the event of a campus emergency that disrupts academic activities, course requirements, deadlines, and
grading percentages are subject to change. Information about changes in this course will be communicated
as soon as possible by email and on Canvas. If we are not able to meet face-to-face, students should
immediately log onto Canvas and read any announcements and/or access alternative assignments. Students
arealsoencouragedtocontinuethereadingsandotherassignmentsasoutlinedinthissyllabusorsubsequent
versions of the syllabus.
