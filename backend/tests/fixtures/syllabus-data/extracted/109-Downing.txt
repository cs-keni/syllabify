This is a course on competitive programming using C++, Java, and Python.
Estimates of the required effort to do well are:
1 hour per week of studying
3 hours per week of programming
1,000 lines of code
There's also a companion UTCS club to the class: UTCS Competitive Programming Club
(https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/utpc/).
Getting Started
1. Sign into Canvas (https://utexas.instructure.com/courses/1144054/) and confirm that you're registered for
the course and can see your grades. It's imperative that you check your grades on a regular basis.
2. Sign into Piazza (https://piazza.com/utexas/fall2015/cs109/). The assistants and I will not respond to e-mail
unless it's of a personal nature. All questions must be asked on Piazza.
3. Sign into Top Hat (https://app.tophat.com/e/109772/). Attendance and quizzes will be managed by Top
Hat. It costs either $24/term or $36/year (https://tophat.com/pricing/).
4. Get a Codeforces account (http://codeforces.com).
5. Get g++ 4.8 (c++ 11) (https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.8/) installed on your machine. The CS network has:
% g++ --version
g++ (Ubuntu 4.8.4-2ubuntu1~14.04) 4.8.4

Special Needs
Any student with a documented disability who requires academic accommodations should contact Services for
Students with Disabilities at 471-6259 (voice) or 1-866-329-3986 (Video Phone) as soon as possible to request an
official letter (https://utexas.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_8pEFQipZiaQ77St) outlining authorized accommodations.
You must provide this letter to me by the 12th class day. Project deadlines will not be extended for special-needs
students.

Incompletes
To be eligible for an incomplete you must have a letter grade of C or better and a written, verifiable excuse for
missing the last test. This is a necessary but insufficient condition for receiving an incomplete.
Academic Integrity
Students who violate University rules on academic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary penalties, including the
possibility of failure in the course and/or dismissal from the University. Since such dishonesty harms the individual,
all students, and the integrity of the University, policies on academic dishonesty will be strictly enforced. For further
information please visit the Student Judicial Services Web site: Student Judicial Services
(http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/).
Programming assignments will be compared using Moss (http://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/). You may
design ideas with your fellow students. You may not share code in any way with your fellow students.
The penalty for academic dishonesty will be a course grade of F and a referral of the case to the Dean of Students
(http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu). Further penalties, including suspension or expulsion from the university may be
imposed by that office.
