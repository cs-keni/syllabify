BA 284T – Financial Accounting
Fall 2024
Professor Urooj Khan
Course Web Page Available on Canvas (https://canvas.utexas.edu)
COURSE DESCRIPTION AND DETAILS
This course provides a comprehensive, graduate-level introduction to accounting. It is designed to give
managerially oriented users of accounting products the foundations of accounting concepts, the underlying
mechanics, and the overall perspective required to become intelligent users of accounting information. The
course will focus on the typical financial statements (e.g., balance sheets, income statements, and cash flow
statements) along with the environment in which they are produced and used. The overarching perspective is
that accounting reports provide information that is useful for a variety of purposes.
The course design emphasizes that the information content of accounting reports is jointly determined by the
accounting methods used to generate the reports and the environment in which the reports are produced and
used. Thus, the course integrates the study of accounting methods and the study of the accounting environment.
Accounting concerns, in turn, vary with market opportunities, instruments, and organizational arrangements
at hand.
The course is organized into two interrelated modules. First, we review accounting-related institutional details,
the nature of financial reports, audits, and disclosure. This includes the examination of the three main financial
statements, the nature of accrual measurement, and the information perspective that is central to the course.
Second, we explore accounting methods in detail, focusing on revenue recognition, assets, liabilities, and
equity. We explicitly consider accounting issues related to global organizations. Throughout the course, we
explore a variety of settings in which these products are used, emphasizing ethics, data integrity, auditing
regulations, financial statements analysis, and valuation.
LEADERSHIP AND THIS COURSE
The Texas MBA program is designed to develop influential business leaders. The MBA program has identified
four fundamental and broad pillars of leadership: knowledge and understanding, communication and
collaboration, responsibility and integrity, and a worldview of business and society.
In this course, you will enhance your knowledge and understanding of financial reporting (the language of
business). You will enhance your communication and collaboration skills through class discussions, informal
study groups, and projects. You will learn how high-quality, credible financial reporting helps managers to
lead their organizations effectively and with integrity. Finally, the course includes cases and examples of
international companies and reporting practices, which affords you a global perspective on financial reporting.
MATERIALS

Professor Khan BA 284T – Financial Accounting Fall 2024
The course webpage on Canvas (https://canvas.utexas.edu) has everything you need for this course,
including class notes, homework problems, practice exams, and more. The class notes on Canvas are very
comprehensive, so no textbook is assigned for this course. However, if you need a textbook to provide
alternative explanations of the material we cover, I recommend a recent edition of "Financial Accounting for
MBAs," by Easton, Wild, Halsey, and McAnally. A tentative class schedule is included on page 5.
Please note that sharing course materials with anyone not currently enrolled in the course is not
allowed (both giving and receiving). It would be considered a violation of the honor code (and
potentially copyrights).
EVALUATION
Grades will be assessed based on the Pre-MBA Accounting Courseware quizzes, required homework
problem sets, a final project, and a final examination.
(i) Pre-MBA Accounting Courseware quizzes – You were provided with self-study materials, referred to as
Pre-MBA Accounting Courseware, before the financial accounting course began. Pre-MBA Accounting
Courseware is a fully online self-study program in accounting mechanics. There are four units in the self-
study program, each with an end-of-unit quiz. These quizzes will form a small portion (2%) of your overall
course grade. To get the 2% grade credit, you need to score at least 75 percent on each quiz before
proceeding to the next unit to make sure you have reached the intended level of understanding. The
completion date for this activity is 11:59 PM on Sunday, August 25.
(ii) Final Examination – There will be an in-class final examination on Friday, October 18, from 4-8 PM. I
will provide more details about the exam format as we approach the end of the course. The final exam will
account for 63% of your overall course grade.
(iii) Homework Problem Sets – Four homework problem sets accounting for 20% of your overall course
grade are assigned during the course. The homework will be graded for completeness as well as accuracy.
To see the homework that is due, either click on Assignments in the left margin of Canvas or review your
Canvas calendar. Your homework should be submitted as a PDF document on Canvas. To submit your
homework:
• Click on "Assignments" in the left margin of Canvas
• Click on the assignment you wish to upload
• When the assignment is opened, click on Submit Assignment in the right margin
• Browse for the file you wish to upload
• Click Submit Assignment, and you're done
(iii) Final Project—For the final project, you will use your new knowledge of financial reporting by
completing a brief financial statement analysis for a company of your choosing. The final project will
account for 15% of your overall course grade. It can be completed individually or jointly as a team of two.
The final project completion deadline is 11:59 PM on Sunday, October 27. Additional details of the final
project are provided in this document on pages 6-7.
COLLABORATION

Professor Khan BA 284T – Financial Accounting Fall 2024
Collaboration is strongly encouraged to understand this class's study material. However, homework must be
written independently. Further, sharing electronic files for homework and the final project is not permitted,
and collaboration on exams is also not permitted. Please carefully read the policy on academic integrity on
page 9.
GRADES
The MBA Programs Committee approved the following target grade distribution for all Core and Flex Core
courses: A (4.0) 25%, A- (3.67) 20%, B+ (3.33) 15%, B (3.0) 35%, B- or below (2.67) 5%. I hope I will not
have to assign grades of C+ or below, but I will do so if warranted. Your grade in the course will be based
on the following components:
Percentages
Pre-MBA Accounting Coursework Quizzes 2%
Final Examination 63%
Homework Problem Sets 20%
Final Project 15%
Total 100%
To determine final grades, I will rank all students in the class from highest to lowest based on total points. I
will then draw lines between A and A-, A- and B+, etc… based on the guidelines above.
GRADING DISPUTES
I will do my best to grade your work fairly, but grading errors can occur. If you believe I have made an
error, you may request a re-grading of the assignment or exam. Be aware, however, that grading errors can
occur in both directions—errors can make grades too high as well as too low. Therefore, if you request a re-
grading, your entire assignment or exam will be re-graded, and all grading errors will be corrected. By
requesting a re-grade, you accept the possibility that your grade may go either up or down.
To request a re-grade, you must submit a written request within one week from the date on which the
assignment was first returned. The request must state (1) the specific area of dispute, (2) your
recommendation for a change in grade, and (3) an explanation or justification for your recommendation.
PROFESSIONALISM
McCombs Classroom Professionalism Policy. The highest professional standards are expected of all
members of the McCombs community. The collective class reputation and the value of the Texas MBA
experience hinges on this. You should treat the Texas MBA classroom as you would a corporate boardroom.
Faculty are expected to be professional and prepared to deliver value for each and every class session.
Students are expected to be professional in all respects. The Texas MBA classroom experience is enhanced
when:
• Students arrive on time. On time arrival ensures that classes are able to start and finish at the
scheduled time. On time arrival shows respect for both fellow students and faculty and it enhances
learning by reducing avoidable distractions.

Professor Khan BA 284T – Financial Accounting Fall 2024
• Students display their name cards. This permits fellow students and faculty to learn names,
enhancing opportunities for community building and evaluation of in-class contributions.
• Students are fully prepared for each class. Much of the learning in the Texas MBA program takes
place during classroom discussions. When students are not prepared, they cannot contribute to the
overall learning process. This affects not only the individual, but their peers who count on them, as
well.
• Students respect the views and opinions of their colleagues. Disagreement and debate are
encouraged. Intolerance for the views of others is unacceptable.
• Students do not confuse the classroom for the cafeteria. The classroom (boardroom) is not the place
to eat your breakfast tacos, wraps, sweet potato fries, or otherwise set up for a picnic. Please plan
accordingly. Recognizing that back-to-back classes sometimes take place over the lunch hour,
energy bars and similar snacks are permitted. Please be respectful of your fellow students and
faculty in your choices.
• Students minimize unscheduled personal breaks. The learning environment improves when
disruptions are limited.
• Students attend the class section to which they are registered. Learning is enhanced when class sizes
are optimized. Limits are set to ensure a quality experience and safety.
• Technology is used to enhance the class experience. When students are surfing the web, responding
to e- mail, messaging each other, and otherwise not devoting their full attention to the topic at hand
they are doing themselves and their peers a major disservice. Those around them face additional
distraction. Fellow students cannot benefit from the insights of the students who are not engaged.
Faculty office hours are spent going over class material with students who chose not to pay
attention, rather than truly adding value by helping students who want a better understanding of the
material or want to explore the issues in more depth. Students with real needs may not be able to
obtain adequate help if faculty time is spent repeating what was said in class. There are often cases
where learning is enhanced by the use of technology in class. Faculty will let you know when it is
appropriate.
• Phones and wireless devices are turned off. We've all heard the annoying ringing in the middle of a
meeting. Not only is it not professional, it cuts off the flow of discussion when the search for the
offender begins. When a true need to communicate with someone outside of class exists (e.g., for
some medical need) please inform the professor prior to class.

FINAL PROJECT DETAILS
Your "final project" is a financial statement analysis of a company you select. The ratios you are asked to
compute are discussed in the class notes.
Your completed project should include:
• A completed table of ratios and other financial statement measures for the company you select. This
table is shown at the bottom of the next page.
• A brief written document (1-2 pages, single spaced) evaluating your company's financial ratios,
comprising the following four sections:
Section I—A brief (1-3 sentences) summary of your company's business and the economic environment
in which it operates.
Section II—A brief evaluation over time of your company's:
- Return on equity (ROE),
- DuPont ratio components (profitability, efficiency, and leverage), and
- LT Debt-to-Assets ratio
Section III—A brief evaluation over time of your company's:
- Cash conversion cycle
- Cash liquidity and Cash Sources & Uses
Section IV— A brief (e.g., 1-2 sentence) description of the overall ratio trend and what it implies for current
and future financial performance.
For written documents, each section should have an appropriate heading and the writing should be in the
form of sentences and paragraphs, not bullet points.
You may confer with colleagues and use any other resources, including me or the TAs, in thinking about
your financial statement analysis. However, you must individually complete your response to this
assignment.
You will probably be able to find all of the financial statement information you need on the company's
website (likely in a section titled "Investor Relations"). Note that you will have to look at more than one
annual report to get enough years of data to do all of the computations. If you have trouble finding the
information, you should select another company.
COMPANY SELECTION
By midnight on Sunday, September 15, you should submit via Canvas the name of the company you have
selected to analyze and declare whether you will be doing the project individually or as a team. If you plan
to work as a team, please announce the full name of your teammate. To do this, use the "Discussion Board"
link at Canvas entitled "DISCUSSION BOARD, Select Your Company" and follow the directions.
Each member/team of a section must select a different company. Company selection is on a first-come, first-
served basis, as established by your posting to the discussion board. Please review the discussion board to
confirm that the company you wish to select has not already been selected. The company you select may be
almost any publicly traded company of your choosing. However, please ensure that the company has data for
all of the ratios below. This especially means that the company has (a) accounts receivable, (b) inventory,
6

Professor Khan BA 284T – Financial Accounting Fall 2024
and (c) accounts payable. This will eliminate companies in certain industries (such as financial services).
Also, avoid choosing companies with negative earnings (or losses) and shareholders' equity.
FINAL PROJECT DEADLINE
Your company analysis is due by midnight on Sunday, October 27. I strongly encourage you to chip away at
the assignment during the semester. You are welcome to submit the assignment before the deadline if you
have completed it early.
You should submit the assignment directly to Canvas, similar to the way in which you submit homework.
Please do not turn in copies of the company's financial statements or the spreadsheet you used to compute
your ratios.
Copy the table below into your report (also available as a Word document titled “Final Project Ratios
Template” under Files on Canvas) and complete the ratios for all three years.

POLICIES
STATEMENT ON LEARNING SUCCESS
Your success in this class is important to me. We will all need accommodations because we all learn
differently. If there are aspects of this course that prevent you from learning or exclude you, please let me
know as soon as possible. Together we'll develop strategies to meet both your needs and the requirements of
the course. I also encourage you to reach out to the student resources available through UT. Many are listed
on this syllabus, but I am happy to connect you with a person or Center if you would like.
RELIGIOUS HOLY DAYS
By UT Austin policy, you must notify me of your pending absence at least fourteen days prior to the date of
observance of a religious holy day. If you must miss a class, an examination, a work assignment, or a project
in order to observe a religious holy day, you will be given an opportunity to complete the missed work
within a reasonable time after the absence.
SHARING OF COURSE MATERIALS IS PROHIBITED

It is a violation of the University's Student Honor Code and an act of academic dishonesty. I am well aware
of the sites used for sharing materials, and any materials found online that are associated with you, or any
suspected unauthorized sharing of materials, will be reported to Student Conduct and Academic Integrity in
the Office of the Dean of Students. These reports can result in sanctions, including failure in the course.
FERPA AND CLASS RECORDINGS
Class recordings are reserved only for students in this class for educational purposes and are protected under
FERPA. The recordings should not be shared outside the class in any form. Violation of this restriction by a
student could lead to Student Misconduct proceedings.

COUNSELING AND MENTAL HEALTH CENTER
Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising, avoiding drugs and
alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and cope
with stress.
All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not alone. There are many helpful resources
available on campus and an important part of the college experience is learning how to ask for help. Asking
for support sooner rather than later is often helpful.

TITLE IX REPORTING
Title IX is a federal law that protects against sex and gender-based discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual
assault, sexual misconduct, dating/domestic violence and stalking at federally funded educational
institutions. UT Austin is committed to fostering a learning and working environment free from
discrimination in all its forms. When sexual misconduct occurs in our community, the university can:
1. Intervene to prevent harmful behavior from continuing or escalating.
2. Provide support and remedies to students and employees who have experienced harm or have
become involved in a Title IX investigation.
3. Investigate and discipline violations of the university's relevant policies.
Faculty members and certain staff members are considered "Responsible Employees" or "Mandatory
Reporters," which means that they are required to report violations of Title IX to the Title IX Coordinator. I
am a Responsible Employee and must report any Title IX related incidents that are disclosed in writing,
discussion, or one-on-one. Before talking with me, or with any faculty or staff member about a Title IX
related incident, be sure to ask whether they are a responsible employee. If you want to speak with someone
for support or remedies without making an official report to the university, email
advocate@austin.utexas.edu For more information about reporting options and resources, visit
titleix.utexas.edu or contact the Title IX Office at titleix@austin.utexas.edu.
EMERGENCY EVACUATION
Occupants of buildings on The University of Texas at Austin campus are required to evacuate buildings
