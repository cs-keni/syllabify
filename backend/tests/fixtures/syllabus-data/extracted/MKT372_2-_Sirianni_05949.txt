Course Description:
Contemporary approaches to business strategy emphasize the importance of adopting a
customer focus. Marketing, in particular, begins and ends with the consumer – from
uncovering consumer needs to ensuring post-purchase satisfaction and customer loyalty.
The primary goal of this course is to enhance your understanding of consumer psychology
and buyer behavior. In this course, you will have the opportunity to learn how to: (1)
recognize how internal and external factors influence consumers’ decision-making
progresses, (2) identify how specific sociological and psychological factors may affect
consumer behavior, and (3) apply terminology, concepts, and principles of consumer
behavior to solve marketing problems.
Throughout the semester, you will apply your knowledge of consumer behavior through
active class participation, as well as participation in in-class exercises, case preparation,
exams, presentations, and collaborative class discussions.
Teaching Philosophy:
My philosophy of teaching is to engage the class to bring about creative thinking and
innovative solutions to business problems. I will use examples, current events and historical
occurrences to bring concepts to life. I also want to hear about marketing and consumer
behavior concepts that the student has discovered in the business world, and what they
believe the firm’s strategy was attempting to accomplish. My goal is to inspire students to
start thinking creatively about marketing and consumer behavior.

Course Materials:
Reference textbook: Consumer Behavior: Building Marketing Strategy, 13th Edition or
later, Mothersbaugh & Hawkins, McGraw Hill (not required)
One consumer behavior-related book from the class book list for the Lightning Talk
Book Presentation – see Canvas for book list (required)
Class Attendance:
Although attendance is expected, I do understand that circumstances can arise that require
you to be absent, particularly given recent world health events.
If you are ill or have been exposed to someone who is ill, please follow university health and
safety standards to minimize exposure and community spread on campus.
If you must miss class for any reason, please arrange with a classmate to get notes, any
additional assignments or materials that may have been distributed in class, and to discuss
any material missed. The responsibility of gathering notes and missed materials lies solely
with the student.
Course Requirements and Grading:
Grades will be determined based on the following criteria:
GRADING
Requirements Grade Points
Exams (3 at 100 points maximum each) 300
Lightning Talk Book Presentation & 100
3 Milestone Achievement Reports
Class Participation & Casework 100
60 points – Class Participation Journal Paper
40 points – Case Discussion Participation (4 cases at 10
points maximum each)
TOTAL 500 total points
Your grade will be solely a result of performance on the assignments and exams. Unless
otherwise specified, assignments are due at the beginning of the class period and are
considered late if received at the end of the class period. Late assignments will be docked 10
points immediately, and then an additional 10 points per day that they are late.
While I want you to feel free to meet with me about problems or concerns, I will not adjust
grades because of factors outside of the course (e.g., GPA trouble, work conflicts, personal
problems, family or roommate issues, scholarship or sport eligibility issues, etc.).
I want you to do well, but there is also a need to be fair to all class members.

Plus/minus grades will be assigned at the end of the course using the following scale:
95%-100% A 68%-69.99% D+
90%-94.99% A- 63%-67.99% D
88%-89.99% B+ 60%-62.99% D-
83%-87.99% B Below 60% F
80%-82.99% B-
78%-79.99% C+
73%-77.99% C
70%-72.99% C-
Please note: Final grades will not be “rounded up” at the end of the semester.
Canvas:
The course Canvas site will contain all PowerPoint presentations and any supplemental
materials for the course. I will also use Canvas to send course announcements when
necessary, and to post recordings of lectures. Please make sure you regularly check your
university email account for any Canvas-generated course announcements.
Resource Help:
If you are experiencing any problems in this class, please let me know as early in the
semester as possible so that I may help you address them.
Exams:
Exams will contain true/false and multiple-choice questions. Questions will cover assigned
textbook material and lectures. Exams MAY NOT be taken from the classroom or copied
from the class Canvas site. A violation of this rule will be considered academic
dishonesty/cheating and will be enforced as such.
There are no “do-overs” or second chances to “re-take” exams. Please do not ask for an
exception. Except for university-approved excused absences, if a student misses an exam,
they will receive a zero.
Make-up exams will be offered for university “excused” absences with proper
documentation (doctor’s note, etc.). All make-up exams must be scheduled with me in
advance of the student’s exam absence. Again, students must receive prior approval to
take a make-up exam. Students are allowed no more than one excused absence for exams.
Once a student has been excused for missing an exam, that student is not allowed to miss
another exam day.

Lightning Talk Book Presentation
The purpose of the lightning talk book presentation is to provide exposure to relevant trends
related to consumer behavior. Each student will have 3 minutes maximum to present their
analysis of their chosen book. The lightning talk should be brief, yet informative. Note: you
will lose points if you go over the 3 minute mark and if you go grossly under the 3 minute
mark. This talk will take precision and practice to “stick your landing” on time. The
presentation should include the following components, and will be graded as follows:
Key Concept: Summarize the most important, most interesting concept from the book in
your opinion. Teach us something new that you learned from the book. I don’t expect you to
cover everything, but it should be evident that you read the book. Choose your favorite book
concept that you can explain clearly and succinctly. Synthesize this information so that you
can own it and explain it in your own words.
Business Application: Explain how the book sheds light on current industry practices.
Provide at least one specific, detailed example from the book that illustrates how the book’s
concepts can be applied in today’s business environment. For example, how are companies
applying the author’s concept(s)? Or if they aren’t being currently applied, how might
companies improve their offerings if they adopted one of the author’s concepts? Show us if
you can (photos, video footage from the field, etc.) rather than just telling us. Do some
research; make these connections on your own. Don’t expect the author to provide these
examples for you. This is a test to demonstrate that you can translate the book content to
what’s going on in the real world of business.
Class Concepts Application: What CB terms or concepts from our class this semester were
demonstrated in the book? What parallels can you draw from your book and our class
lectures? Details matter (don’t just say “what we covered in chapter 6”). Explain! This is a
test to demonstrate that you can translate the book content to what we’ve covered in class
this semester. Make smart connections! Show us what you’ve learned this semester!
Creativity/Style: We will be viewing many different presentations (35+). Engaging the class
(and me!) is critical to a successful presentation. Students are expected to prepare their
presentations in a way that will engage other class members. Involve and engage the
audience in your talk if you possibly can. Be uniquely you – let your personality shine.
Requirements: Make sure to use visuals (such a 3-5 powerpoint slides, hand made signs,
photos, art, etc. it’s great to be creative here too) – at the bare minimum, please include
your full name, as well as your book title and the book’s author on the first slide or sign of
your visuals. Please clearly label the Key Concept, Business Application, and Class Concepts
Application with visuals/titles. This helps me immensely in grading – thank you!
Deliverables:
- Throughout the semester, I will check in to see how you are progressing with this project
and to learn if you have any questions/issues. See the class schedule (posted to Canvas) for
Milestone Due Dates. Milestone 1-3 deliverables will be turned in in via Canvas.
- On the first day of class presentations, upload your 3 minute lightning talk script and any
visuals (via a PDF document) to Canvas as your deliverable.

Class Participation Journal Paper:
Value is co-created. To have a valuable and beneficial class experience, you must embrace
your role in this process. It is my intention to make our time in class as interactive as possible
when I can. Active participation in class activities is a critical component of your learning and
success. Participation entails active engagement with the course material and in-class
activities – both by sharing your own unique observations, examples, and questions with
others (in person, safely when possible), and by noting them to yourself in your journal
paper. It is important to draw your own connections with the material to aid in your learning
process. There will also be numerous class activities and discussions (available both in
person and by viewing recorded lectures when necessary), and required case days that
comprise a significant part of your overall class participation grade.
On the last day of class, you will turn in a typed summary of your participation in which you
will provide a score for yourself (from 0 to 60 points) that reflects your perception of your
level of lecture attendance, participation, engagement with course material, and value co-
creation, as well as justification for the percentage you have scored yourself. In this paper,
you will be expected to provide a detailed description of your semester-long attendance or
video viewing if you cannot attend class (a bulleted list of class dates is fine), with specific
descriptions of your engagement and participation. Keeping an active course diary or
journal of active, constructive engagement with course material will go a long way in
making this an easy assignment.
To provide an idea of how you might go about evaluating your level of class lecture
attendance, participation, engagement with course material, & value co-creation, here is
how I would assign a typical class participation score:
1. A 100% would be scored for someone who is always prepared, frequently initiates stimulating and thought-provoking
questions when possible during in person class, often brings outside articles and examples that illustrate course
concepts, and serves as a role model or leader for other students. Attends every class and/or watches all video
recordings when class attendance is not possible. This students’ class participation journal paper would be extremely
detailed and lengthy, with a unique observation or two (or more!) for every lecture. Note: a 100% is extremely rare.
(60/60 points)
2. A consistent contributor to class discussions (when possible) who responds to instructor questions and comments (and
journal prompts during lectures and recordings) would receive an 85%. (51/60 points)
3. An occasional contributor to class discussions, sometimes responds to instructor questions (and journal prompts
during lectures and recordings) but never volunteers to answer/comment/offer insights on their own would receive a
60%. (36/60 points)
4. Someone who rarely attends classes or watches recorded lectures, does not take part in class discussions, and does not
provide much detail in their class participation journal paper would receive a 40%. Note: Simply attending class or
watching class videos puts you here. Class participation means active engagement with the material as evidenced by
description and details in your paper. (24/60 points)
5. Someone who completely avoids any attempt to contribute or engage with the course material, and hands in a
virtually empty class participation journal paper (or does not hand in a paper at all) would receive a 0%. (0/60 points)
Your Class Attendance & Lecture Participation Paper should explicitly provide your suggested
score (from 0 to 60 points). Please do not provide a grade range or a “wishful” grade. I
reserve the right to make adjustments to your suggested participation score if I believe it is
warranted.

Notes on Grading Class Participation:
Please note that class participation takes into account student activities that disrupt and/or
hamper good class discussion. These include partaking in private conversations with fellow
students, the improper use of smart phones (including text messaging), the improper use of
laptop computers, and making discourteous remarks about other students. Engaging in
these kinds of activities will greatly lower one’s attendance and participation grade
regardless of the value of the student’s other comments or the student’s attendance record.
Consequently, if you are acting unprofessionally, I will deduct points from your total
course grade points for every instance of unprofessional behavior (with or without notice
to the offending student).
Case Assignments:
On days in which we are hosting a case assignment, you should come to class prepared in
that you will have already read the assigned case. Additionally, come to class prepared to
brainstorm solutions to several pertinent questions regarding information in the case, and
then share these thoughts and ideas in a class discussion.
During case discussions, I strongly encourage creativity, “out of the box” thinking, and
integrating information from the case with information and terminology from class lectures.
Note: There are no right or wrong answers. However, there are good and bad analyses, and
some decisions are more defensible than others. Details and thoughtful responses matter!
Think of the classroom as a safe place to practice making constructive arguments and
backing them up with specific case evidence, as well as sharing your knowledge regarding
current business practices and your own related experiences as a consumer.
What is most important is the process of arriving at your own conclusions and
recommendations by marshaling evidence in the case, and applying careful and logical
thinking along with concepts and terminology from the associated textbook chapter/course
topic. Case days typically result in lively and creative class discussions – these are not
intended to be stressful, but rather fun and interesting ways to apply course concepts in the
real business world.
I encourage all students to step outside of their comfort zone to share their thoughts and
ideas on the assigned cases to enhance everyone’s learning and overall class experience.

University Policies
University Resources for Students
Your success in this class is important to me. We will all need accommodations because we
all learn differently. If there are aspects of this course that prevent you from learning or
exclude you, please let me know as soon as possible. Together we’ll develop strategies to
meet both your needs and the requirements of the course.
There is also a range of resources on campus:
Services for Students with Disabilities
This class respects and welcomes students of all backgrounds, identities, and abilities. If
there are circumstances that make our learning environment and activities difficult, if you
have medical information that you need to share with me, or if you need specific
arrangements in case the building needs to be evacuated, please let me know. I am
committed to creating an effective learning environment for all students, but I can only do so
if you discuss your needs with me as early as possible. I promise to maintain the
confidentiality of these discussions. If appropriate, also contact Services for Students with
Disabilities, 512-471-6259 (voice) or (512) 410-6644 (video phone).
Counseling and Mental Health Center
Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising, avoiding
drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will help you
achieve your goals and cope with stress. All of us benefit from support during times of
struggle. You are not alone. There are many helpful resources available on campus and an
important part of the college experience is learning how to ask for help. Asking for support
sooner rather than later is often helpful. If you or anyone you know experiences any
academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, we strongly
encourage you to seek support. A Counselors in Academic Residence (CARE) Program is
available in each college from the Counseling and Mental Health Center.
The Sanger Learning Center
Did you know that more than one-third of UT undergraduate students use the Sanger
Learning Center each year to improve their academic performance? All students are
welcome to take advantage of Sanger Center’s classes and workshops, private learning
specialist appointments, peer academic coaching, and tutoring for more than 70 courses in
15 different subject areas. For more information, please visit Sanger Learning Center or call
512-471-3614 (JES A332).
Student Emergency Services
UT’s Student Emergency Services provides assistance, intervention, and referrals to support
students navigating challenging or unexpected issues that impact their well-being and
academic success. If you need to be absent from class due to a family emergency, medical or
7

mental health concern, or academic difficulty due to crisis or an emergency situation, please
register with Student Emergency Services. SES will verify your situation and notify your
professors.
Diversity and Inclusion
It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well served by
this course, that students’ learning needs be addressed and that the diversity that students
bring to this class can be comfortably expressed and be viewed as a resource, strength and
benefit to all students. Please come to me at any time with any concerns.
Personal Pronoun Preference
Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals and
topics dealing with differences of race, culture, religion, politics, sexual orientation, gender,
gender variance, and nationalities. Class rosters are provided to the instructor with the
student’s legal name. I will gladly honor your request to address you by a name different
than what appears on the roster, and by the gender pronouns you use. Please advise me of
this preference early in the semester so that I may make appropriate changes to my records.
Religious Holy Days
By UT Austin policy, you must notify me of your pending absence at least fourteen days prior
to the date of observance of a religious holy day. If you must miss a class, an examination, a
work assignment, or a project in order to observe a religious holy day, you will be given an
opportunity to complete the missed work within a reasonable time after the absence.
Policy on Scholastic Dishonesty
The McCombs School of Business has no tolerance for acts of scholastic dishonesty. The
responsibilities of both students and faculty with regard to scholastic dishonesty are
described in detail in the BBA Program’s Statement on Scholastic Dishonesty at
http://my.mccombs.utexas.edu/BBA/Code-of-Ethics. By teaching this course, I have agreed
to observe all faculty responsibilities described there. By enrolling in this class, you have
agreed to observe all student responsibilities described there. If the application of the
Statement on Scholastic Dishonesty to this class or its assignments is unclear in any way, it is
your responsibility to ask me for clarification. Students who violate University rules on
scholastic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary penalties, including the possibility of failure
in the course and/or dismissal from the University. Since dishonesty harms the individual, all
students, the integrity of the University, and the value of our academic brand, policies on
scholastic dishonesty will be strictly enforced. You should refer to the Student Conduct and
Academic Integrity website at http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/conduct/to access the
official University policies and procedures on scholastic dishonesty as well as further
elaboration on what constitutes scholastic dishonesty.

Sharing of Course Materials is Prohibited
No materials used in this class, including, but not limited to, lecture hand-outs, videos,
assessments (quizzes, exams, papers, projects, homework assignments), in-class materials,
review sheets, and additional problem sets, may be shared online or with anyone outside of
the class without explicit, written permission of the instructor. Unauthorized sharing of
materials promotes cheating. It is a violation of the University’s Student Honor Code and an
act of academic dishonesty. The University is well aware of the sites used for sharing
materials, and any materials found on such sites that are associated with a specific student,
or any suspected unauthorized sharing of materials, will be reported to Student Conduct and
Academic Integrity in the Office of the Dean of Students. These reports can result in
sanctions, including failure of the course.
Online Instruction - Getting Help with Zoom
Students needing help with Zoom should refer to the McCombs Student Instructional Wiki
for a set of comprehensive instructions. All McCombs Canvas course pages have this link on
the left menu bar for quick and easy reference.
UT Zoom Account
All students must use a UT Zoom account in order to participate in some classes, office
hours, and some UT affiliated events. For detailed instructions on how to sign up for a UT
Zoom account, see Getting Started with Zoom. You will be denied access to Zoom sessions if
you attempt to access without a valid UT account.
Zoom Professionalism and Etiquette
Following are some best practices for making sure we are working together to create an
efficient, effective, respectful, and ultimately enjoyable classroom when accessing remotely:
• Keep your video on at all times.
• Be mindful of your surroundings when on camera to minimize distractions.
• Avoid display of inappropriate materials or expressions, either visual, textual, or
otherwise. Such displays may be subject to disciplinary action.
• Turn your camera off when leaving the meeting temporarily and use the away
feedback icon.
• Include a professional photo of yourself for your Zoom profile picture. This photo will
be visible during class sessions if you keep your video off.
• Mute yourself unless you are speaking. This will reduce background or feedback noise
and limit distractions.
• Pose questions or comments using the “raise” your hand feature or typing in the chat
window. Try to keep questions and comments brief, especially in large classes.
• Turn off your video if the video or audio is choppy. After the class or meeting, try
these Internet Connection Tips.
• Use the most reliable WIFI you can access. If you are experiencing problems with
your internet connection, here are some Internet Connection Tips.
• For more information, please see Zoom Etiquette.

Class Recording Privacy
Class recordings are reserved only for students in this class for educational purposes and are
protected under FERPA. The recordings should not be shared outside the class in any form.
Violation of this restriction by a student could lead to Student Misconduct proceedings.
McCombs Classroom Professionalism Policy
The highest professional standards are expected of all members of the McCombs
community. The collective class reputation and the value of the Texas BBA experience hinges
on this. You should treat the Texas BBA classroom as you would a professional corporate
environment. Faculty are expected to be professional and prepared to deliver value for every
class session. Students are expected to be professional in all respects. The Texas BBA
classroom experience is enhanced when:
• Students arrive on time. On-time arrival ensures that classes are able to start and
finish at the scheduled time. On-time arrival shows respect for both fellow students
and faculty and it enhances learning by reducing avoidable distractions.
• Students display their name cards. This permits fellow students and faculty to learn
names, enhancing opportunities for community building and evaluation of in-class
contributions.
• Students are fully prepared for each class. Much of the learning in the Texas BBA
program takes place during classroom discussions. When students are not prepared,
they cannot contribute to the overall learning process. This affects not only the
individual but their peers who count on them, as well.
• Students respect the views and opinions of their colleagues. Disagreement and
debate are encouraged. Intolerance for the views of others is unacceptable.
• Students attend the class section to which they are registered. Learning is enhanced
when class sizes are optimized. Limits are set to ensure a quality experience and
safety.
• Technology is used to enhance the class experience. When students are surfing the
web, responding to e-mail, instant messaging each other, and otherwise not devoting
their full attention to the topic at hand, they are doing themselves and their peers a
major disservice. Those around them face additional distractions. Fellow students
cannot benefit from the insights of the students who are not engaged. Faculty office
hours are spent going over class material with students who chose not to pay
attention, rather than truly adding value by helping students who want a better
understanding of the material or want to explore the issues in more depth. Students
with real needs may not be able to obtain adequate help if faculty time is spent
repeating what was said in class. There are often cases where learning is enhanced by
the use of technology in class. Faculty will let you know when it is appropriate.
• Phones and wireless devices are turned off. We’ve all heard the annoying ringing in
the middle of a meeting. Not only is it not professional, but it also cuts off the flow of
discussion when the search for the offender begins. When a true need to
communicate with someone outside of class exists (e.g., for some medical need)
please inform the professor prior to class.

Important Safety Information
If you have concerns about the safety or behavior of fellow students, TAs or Professors, call
BCCAL (the Behavior Concerns and COVID-19 Advice Line): 512-232-5050. Your call can be
anonymous. If something doesn’t feel right – it probably isn’t. Trust your instincts and share
your concerns.
Classroom Safety and COVID-19
To help preserve our in-person learning environment, the university recommends the
following.
• Adhere to university mask guidance. Masks are strongly recommended, but optional,
inside university buildings for vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, except when
alone in a private office or single-occupant cubicle.
• Vaccinations are widely available, free and not billed to health insurance. The vaccine
will help protect against the transmission of the virus to others and reduce serious
symptoms in those who are unvaccinated.
• Proactive Community Testing remains an important part of the university’s efforts to
protect our community. Tests are fast and free.
11

• The university has determined that all students coming to campus for the fall
semester must receive a viral COVID-19 test in their local community within 72 hours
prior to arrival in Austin for move in. If they already reside in Austin, they must test
within 72 hours of moving into the residence where they will reside for the academic
semester. Finally, individuals who are already living in the residence in Austin where
they will reside this academic semester should test within 72 hours (3 days) prior to
the start of class on Aug. 25.
• We encourage the use of the Protect Texas App each day prior to coming to campus.
• If you develop COVID-19 symptoms or feel sick, stay home and contact the University
Health Services’ Nurse Advice Line at 512-475-6877. If you need to be absent from
class, contact Student Emergency Services and they will notify your professors. In
addition, to help understand what to do if you have been had close contact with
someone who tested positive for COVID-19, see this University Health Services link.
• Behavior Concerns and COVID-19 Advice Line (BCCAL) remains available as the
primary tool to address questions or concerns from the university community about
COVID-19.
• Students who test positive should contact BCCAL or self-report (if tested off campus)
to University Health Services.
• Visit Protect Texas Together for more information.
Title IX Reporting
Title IX is a federal law that protects against sex and gender-based discrimination, sexual
harassment, sexual assault, sexual misconduct, dating/domestic violence and stalking at
federally funded educational institutions. UT Austin is committed to fostering a learning and
working environment free from discrimination in all its forms. When sexual misconduct
occurs in our community, the university can:
1. Intervene to prevent harmful behavior from continuing or escalating.
2. Provide support and remedies to students and employees who have experienced
harm or have become involved in a Title IX investigation.
3. Investigate and discipline violations of the university’s relevant policies.
Faculty members and certain staff members (TAs) are considered “Responsible Employees”
or “Mandatory Reporters,” which means that they are required to report violations of Title IX
to the Title IX Coordinator. I am a Responsible Employee and must report any Title IX-
related incidents that are disclosed in writing, discussion, or one-on-one. Before talking with
me or with any faculty or staff member about a Title IX-related incident, be sure to ask
whether they are a responsible employee. If you want to speak with someone for support or
remedies without making an official report to the university, email
advocate@austin.utexas.edu For more information about reporting options and resources,
visit the Title IX Office or email titleix@austin.utexas.edu.
Campus Safety
The following are recommendations regarding emergency evacuation from the Office of
Campus Safety and Security, 512-471-5767,
12

• Occupants of buildings on The University of Texas at Austin campus must evacuate
buildings when a fire alarm is activated. Alarm activation or announcement requires
exiting and assembling outside.
• Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of each classroom and building you may
occupy. Remember that the nearest exit door may not be the one you used when
entering the building.
• Students requiring assistance in evacuation shall inform their instructor in writing
during the first week of class.
• In the event of an evacuation, follow the instruction of faculty or class instructors. Do
not re-enter a building unless given instructions by the following: Austin Fire
Department, The University of Texas at Austin Police Department, or Fire Prevention
Services office.
• For more information, please visit emergency preparedness.
