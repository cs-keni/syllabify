Description: Exploration of the fundamental imaging modalities in “modern” radiology. In particular, we will
introduce basic engineering, physics and physiological and clinical uses of X-ray radiography, computed
tomography (CT), ultrasound (US), optical imaging, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We will use
homework, projects and hands imaging to reinforce and assess learning.
Course Objectives
• Students will learn the physics of image formation in medical imaging
• Students will learn the main instrumentation used in medical imaging
• Students will learn the mathematics of image reconstruction
• Students will learn how to assess image quality in medical imaging
• Students will learn how to use, model and analyze medical imaging systems, images and data

Student Outcomes
• 1. an ability to identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering problems by applying principles of
engineering, science, and mathematics
• 2. an ability to apply engineering design to produce solutions that meet specific needs with consideration
of public health, safety, and welfare, as well as global, cultural, societal, environmental, and economic
factors
• 3. an ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences
• 5. an ability to function effectively on a team whose members together provide leadership, create a
collaborative and inclusive environment, establish goals, plan tasks, and meet objectives
• 6. an ability to develop and conduct appropriate experimentation, analyze and interpret data, and use
engineering judgement to draw conclusions 7. an ability to acquire and apply new knowledge as needed,
using appropriate learning strategies
Program Criteria (PC):
A) Applying principles of engineering, biology, human physiology, chemistry, calculus-based physics,
mathematics (through differential equations) and statistics;
B) Solving bio/biomedical engineering problems, including those associated with the interaction between
living and non-living systems;
C) Analyzing, modeling, designing, and realizing bio/biomedical engineering devices, systems,
components, or processes; and
D) Making measurements on and interpreting data from living systems.
Prerequisites: BME 251 (Biomedical Image, Signal, and Transport Process Laboratory) and BME 348
(Modeling of Biomedical Engineering Systems). This is an elective course.
Grading and Evaluation:
Letter Grades: A = 93-100; A- = 90-92; B+ = 87-89; B = 83-86; B- = 80-82; C+ = 77-79; C = 73-76; C- = 70-
72; D+ = 67-69; D = 63-66; D- = 60-62; F = 0-59
You will be scored against the rubric, NOT against each other. Should the median of the class grades be less
than 80% at the end of the term, the final grades may be curved as the instructor sees fit.
Category Final Grade Percentage
Class Participation 25%
Exam 1 25%
Monday Assignments and Homework 50%
Exam 2 25%
Dropped Score:
The lowest category score will be dropped from your final grade score. Should your lowest score be in the
homework and Monday assignments category, it will only contribute 25% to your final grade.

Class Participation: Class participation will be assessed via participation during in class question and answer
periods using the Kahoot platform. Full credit will be awarded for participation.
Monday Assignments and Homework: Weekly assignments will be posted prior to 4pm on Monday and due the
following Monday by 11:59pm CST. Longer assignments will be occasionally assigned and will be weighted in
the category grade based on their assigned duration. For instance, a two week assignment is worth twice as
much as a one week assignment. You are free to work together to solve the assigned homework problems,
however, the work appearing on your submitted homework assignment must be your own. Some topics will
require MATLAB based simulation, image processing or use of image systems and supplies only available
during the Monday class period. Plan accordingly. Late assignments will be penalized -25% per day.
COVID and Sickness Policy: Students are encouraged not to attend class while ill. Notify Dr. Bush as soon as
possible. Illness must be reported BEFORE a missed class period for class participation to be excused. Any
missed class participation and homework assignments during an excused illness will not be counted against
your final participation or homework grade.

Instructor reserves the right to modify course policies, the course schedule, and assignment point values and due
dates.
Drop Policy:
The last day to drop this course without permission from the Dean is the 4th class day. After this day, drops are
approved only in the case of health or personal problems. An engineering student should make an appointment
with his/her departmental advisor to discuss adding or dropping any course if the change will alter the classes
that were originally approved by the departmental advisor. If the add or drop requires the approval of the Dean,
then the student will need to schedule an appointment with an Academic Advisor in the Office of Student
Affairs to discuss the request. Additional information can be found at:
http://www.engr.utexas.edu/current/policies/pol_add-drop-wdraw.cfm
Academic Dishonesty:
Cheating will be dealt with in the harshest possibly way, according to the policies established by the office of
the Dean of Students.
Class Recordings:
Class recordings are reserved only for students in this class for educational purposes and are protected under
FERPA. The recordings should not be shared outside the class in any form. Violation of this restriction by a
student could lead to Student Misconduct proceedings.

Regrade Policy:
If you want your Exam regraded, you must approach me within 1 week of getting your homework/project score
back.
Religious Holy Days:
A student who misses classes or other required activities, including examinations, for the observance
of a religious holy day should inform the instructor at least 14 days in advance of the absence so that
arrangements can be made to complete an assignment within a reasonable period after the absence.
Students who have questions or concerns may contact the Office for Inclusion and Equity
Students with disability:
The University of Texas at Austin provides, upon request, appropriate academic accommodations for qualified
students with disabilities. For more information, contact Services for Students with Disabilities at 512-471-6259
or ssd@austin.utexas.edu.
Classroom Evacuation for Students:
All occupants of university buildings are required to evacuate a building when a fire alarm and/ or an official
announcement is made indicating a potentially dangerous situation within the building. Familiarize yourself
with all exit doors of each classroom and building you may occupy. Re- member that the nearest exit door may
not be the one you used when entering the building. If you require assistance in evacuation, inform your
instructor in writing during the first week of class. For evacuation in your classroom or building:
1. Follow the instructions of faculty and teaching staff.
2. Exit in an orderly fashion and assemble outside.
3. Do not re-enter a building unless given instructions by emergency personnel.
