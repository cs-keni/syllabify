CS 314: Data Structures
Spring 2015: TTh 2:00 - 3:30 in GDC 2.216, Unique Nos. 51755, 51760, 51765.
Instructor: Gordon S. Novak Jr., GDC 3.824; Office Hours: T Th 3:30 - 5:00.
Teaching Assistant:
Bing Ai bingai@cs.utexas.edu Office Hours: M W 1:30 - 2:30, F 4-5 in GDC 1.302, TA
Desk 1.
Lab Proctor will be in the Level 3 GDC labs to help with programming projects:
Optional Text: Mark Allen Weiss, Data Structures & Problem Solving Using Java, 4th Ed.; Amazon;
textbooks.com. Reading in Weiss
Optional Text: Eric S. Roberts, Thinking Recursively with Java ; Amazon.
iClicker: Each student is required to buy/rent an iClicker (any version of iClicker device; not iClicker
GO app). This will be used for attendance and to reinforce and practice with the class material. Two
iClicker points are given just for voting, and an additional point is given for a correct answer. Most
iClicker questions and answers are online at Clicker Questions, and it is okay to review them in
advance. The clicker scores will be converted to a grade by making the highest student score at least 108
and linearly scaling other scores; this gives some extra points to account for minor illness, forgotten or
malfunctioning clicker, etc. Adjustments to clicker scores will only be made for significant causes such
as major illness. Bringing another student's clicker to class is considered to be cheating.
Course Notes: Available in printed form at Copy Center, GSB 3.136 . Strongly recommended.

Programming assignments will mainly be done in Java, with options to do some in Lisp. Program files
may be provided for use with the assignments, in the directory /projects/cs314/ or in the FTP
directory for Program Files, ftp://ftp.cs.utexas.edu/pub/novak/cs314/, and in
http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/novak/cs314/. It is legal to use any of these files as part of your
programs.
Prerequisite: CS 312 or 312H with a grade of at least C-.
Topics:
Introduction: why we need clever algorithms and data structures.
Performance: Big O: how much time and storage are needed as data sizes become large
Some Lisp: (+ x 3)
Lists and Recursion; Stacks and Queues
Arrays

Grading:
Grades are kept on Canvas. It is your responsibility to check your grades often to make sure that your
assignments have been received and graded.
Course grades are assigned on the scale A = 93-100, A- = 90-93, B+ = 87-90, B = 83-87, B- = 80-83,
etc. provided that the Final Exam grade is at least 65; if the Final Exam grade is below 65, a lower
course grade may be assigned at the instructor's discretion. Grades are averaged using the following
weights:
Clicker Participation 10%
Midterm Exam 20% Thursday, March 12, in class
Final Exam 30% Thursday, May 14, 2-5 PM
Programming Assignments40%
There will be a 10% per day late penalty for late programming assignments up to 4 days; no late
assignments will be accepted after 4 days. It is the student's responsibility to submit assignments
correctly using Canvas.
Programming projects must be your own individual work. Students may discuss concepts or help
with specific problems in another student's code. However, sharing code constitutes plagiarism. The
Moss program will sometimes be used to detect duplicated programs. It is not possible to pass the course
without doing the programming assignments.
