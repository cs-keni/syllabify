SQL from Class.
Types of Joins:
Inner Joins - the following 3 are essentially the same except for syntax:
select * from emp e, dept d where e.deptno = d.deptno
select * from emp e join dept d on e.deptno = d.deptno
select * from emp e inner join dept d on e.deptno = d.deptno
Outer Joins:
select * from emp e right outer join dept d on e.deptno = d.deptno
select * from emp e left outer join dept d on e.deptno = d.deptno
select * from emp e full outer join dept d on e.deptno = d.deptno
Self Join
SELECT e1.*, 'Manager is: ' || e2.ename
FROM EMP e1 left outer join EMP e2
on e2.empno = e1.mgr
See also http://stackoverflow.com/questions/38549/difference-between-inner-and-outer-joins for more
details.
Group By:
select job, round(avg(sal), 2) from emp
where sal > 2000
group by job
having round(avg(sal), 2) > 3000
Views:
create view emp_v1 as select ename, job, mgr from emp
select * from emp_v1
