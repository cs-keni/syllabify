BRAND MANAGEMENT
Spring Semester 2022
TTH 3:30 – 4:45pm
GSB 3.128
Class meetings will be conducted entirely in-person, except when the university advises online-
only courses due to COVID conditions or inclement weather, or when needed to facilitate an off-
site guest speaker. While the Active Learning Classroom assigned for this course enhances small
group discussions and teamwork on group assignments, it does not facilitate hybrid class session
recordings adequately. Students who cannot attend an in-person class session due to COVID
illness/quarantine or other justifiable reasons should proactively communicate and collaborate
with the instructor, teaching assistant and classmates to ensure they are able to achieve the
course’s learning objectives, engage with their brand audit project teams, and complete all
required assignments.
Please refer to the Canvas site for this course for additional information and updates, as it is
possible that health and safety conditions will evolve during the semester.

COURSE DESCRIPTION
The most valuable asset many firms have is their brand. In our global economy, product and
service offerings can be replicated by competing firms, while the knowledge and attitudes
consumers have about brands is not easily duplicated. Therefore, many companies recognize that
the investment they make in the creation and communication of their brand will become a
strategic differentiator in the future.
This course will focus on the art and science of branding as a fundamental element of marketing
strategy. Students will get hands-on experience with strategies, frameworks, and specific tactics
for building, leveraging, and defending strong brands in any industry. All aspects covered will be in
the context of actual applications of brand concepts to real-world challenges. Discussions will
focus on current opportunities and challenges facing brand managers in a variety of industries and
markets.
COURSE OVERVIEW
In order to focus the class experience on deeper understanding of the core concepts and real-
world applications, students are expected to complete the assigned readings in advance.
Class sessions will typically consist of brief class lectures reinforcing key points from the readings,
followed by interactive case discussions and individual/team exercises that apply the concepts to
real-world situations. Lecture Slides for each class session will be posted on Canvas prior to class,
and you are encouraged to download and preview them prior to class. However, these slides will
not contain the depth of information conveyed in class.
Each student will be asked to participate actively in class sessions, and to not just be a passive
observer. Case preparation homework assignments will encourage students to form their opinions
and questions about the case material in advance. If I call upon you directly in a class discussion, it
is not an attempt to embarrass you. Knowing that you come from various backgrounds and
experiences, I simply hope that each of you will contribute to the depth of knowledge shared in
this class.
Guest speakers will connect course topics to their experience in the real world at a few points
during the semester.
PREREQUISITES

Brand Audit Team Project & Presentation (50% of Final Grade)
Each student will participate in the development of a multi-phase brand audit project as part of a
team. In order to maximize the diversity of backgrounds on each team, Prof. Brister and the TA
will manage the team assignments. Each team will choose a different brand to study, and at the
end of the semester each team present their insights and recommendations to the entire class.
The purpose of this assignment is to help develop your brand research and analysis skills, and to
allow students to apply multiple branding concepts to a real world business case. More detailed
information on this project will be distributed early in the semester and posted on Canvas.

8. Individual Contribution to Team Friday 5/6 10% of Final Grade
• Each student will receive an individual contribution grade based on self-evaluation,
peer evaluations, and professor/TA observations.
Brief Quizzes on Required Readings (10% of Final Grade)
To encourage students to complete the assigned readings in advance, an online open-book quiz
with 3-5 questions covering key concepts from required readings must be completed prior to class.
Students are expected to complete these quizzes on their own, without consulting fellow students.
As these quizzes will be very straightforward, many students will earn a 100 average on this
component of their grade. Each student’s two lowest quiz grades will be dropped to allow for an
occasion where they are not able to keep up with the required readings. The final grade will be
based on the percentage of points earned vs. total possible points.
Examinations (20% of Final Grade)
There will be two take-home exams comprised of short-answer questions, and each will count for
10% of your course grade. Each exam will available online for a period of 5 days leading up to the
due dates noted above. You may spend as much time as you would like completing the exam, and
it is open-book/open-notes. The objective of the exams is to assess your mastery of important
learning objectives and to allow you to demonstrate your ability to independently apply the
concepts you’ve learned to specific problems.
Case-Based Homework Assignments (10% of Final Grade)
For each of the 7 assigned cases, a set of homework questions will be provided on Canvas. You
will need to draft your answers to these questions, and submit a 1-2 page Word document prior to
class. These are not full/formal case briefings. For some cases you will answer a few specific
questions, and for others you will write a brief decision analysis memo.
To receive credit for each assignment, you must submit your responses online through Canvas
prior to the start of class. These homework assignments will receive points based on the following
criteria:
• 3 points = Excellent level of completion
• 2 points = Average level of completion
• 1 point = Minimum level of completion
• 0 points = Insufficient level of completion/Missing
Late assignments will not be accepted; however, you will receive credit for all homework
submitted prior to class even if you are unable to attend. Your lowest homework assignment
score will be dropped, for example if you were unable to complete the case homework prior to
class.
Students should be aware that these assignments will be submitted to a plagiarism detection tool
such as Turnitin.com. Turnitin is a software resource intended to address plagiarism and improper
citation. The software works by cross-referencing submitted materials with an archived database
of journals, essay, newspaper articles, books, and other published work. In addition, other

Prof. Steve Brister MKT 372 Brand Management (#05955) 6
methods may be used to determine the originality of the paper. This software is not intended to
replace or substitute for the faculty member's judgment regarding detection of plagiarism.
The final homework grade for each student will be calculated based on their total points as a
percentage of the potential homework points. For example, if a student earns 3 points on each of
four assignments, 2 points on each of two assignments, and does not complete one assignment,
they have earned 16 points out of a maximum of 18, and will receive a grade of 88.9.
Class Discussion Contributions (10% of Final Grade)
Each class, you will have the opportunity to earn a classroom contribution point by making a
significant contribution to class discussion by providing an excellent answer to questions, posing
relevant questions, and providing insightful observations. To earn the contribution point, student
comments should:
• Demonstrate a deep understanding of the topic
• Contribute an important insight based on the topic, or clarify an important issue
• Consider previous points raised in the class, building on them or providing an alternative
point of view
• Move the discussion forward, not backwards
Comments that simply state the obvious or repeat prior points made by other students will not
earn a contribution point. After many class sessions, an additional method for contributing to the
discussion via a post-class discussion board will be available to students who do not do so verbally
in class.
In some class sessions throughout the course, individual and/or team exercises will provide
students with an opportunity to earn an additional class contribution point. Examples of these
exercises include:
• Worksheets applying key concepts
• Brand Audit project-based team exercises
• Providing audience evaluations of team presentations
Note that these exercises will only earn a point if submission is considered sufficiently complete in
the judgment of the TA.
There are no makeup opportunities for in-class contributions and exercises. Consequently, if you
miss a class session, or arrive/depart such that you miss the exercise, you will not earn a point for
the exercise.
Your cumulative earned classroom contribution and exercise points will be posted on Canvas at
the midpoint of the semester, and the current class average will be announced. At the end of the
semester, your final classroom contribution grade will be based on the distribution of points across
the class as follows:
• Above the class average: 95 – 100 final grade
• Equal to the class average: 90 final grade
• Below the class average: 50 – 85 final grade

Prof. Steve Brister MKT 372 Brand Management (#05955) 7
COURSE ENVIRONMENT
Each student should take personal responsibility for helping create a positive, productive class
environment. This includes common courtesies such as arriving on time, silencing your cell phone,
and refraining from texting, eating and having personal conversations during class. Please do your
best to get the most out of each class session by avoiding multi-tasking, checking email,
messaging, etc.
Use of personal digital devices (i.e., laptops, tablets, smartphones, etc.) will be allowed in class.
However, use should be limited to activities that support the course’s learning objectives – taking
notes, researching/providing information relevant to class discussions (assuming it does not take
time and attention away from class activities), and accessing class material on Canvas.
Due to interactive nature of this course, it is critical that all students make an effort to get to know
all of their classmates, and that they help the instructor build a learning community that is fully
inclusive and that respects the perspectives and input of all students.
In order to promote academic integrity and provide a fair environment for all students, all exam
and project requirements will be strictly enforced. Any infractions will be reported to Student
Judicial Services.
INSTRUCTOR BIO
I grew up in Waco, TX and earned an MBA in Marketing from the University of Texas after
completing a BA degree in Economics and History at Duke University. A few years ago, I returned
to UT in order to share marketing insights from my professional experience with the next
generation of marketing and business leaders.
I began my marketing career by working at several advertising, direct marketing and branding
agencies, including Leo Burnett (Chicago) and Landor Associates (San Francisco). My first “client-
side” experience was at DirecTV (Los Angeles), where I led the customer acquisition and e-business
marketing teams. Later, I served as a Regional VP of Marketing for Time Warner Cable (Los
Angeles), with responsibility for marketing functions including brand development, product
marketing, customer acquisition and retention, and revenue development.
I keep busy outside of class with administrative responsibilities (as Asst. Chair of the Marketing
Department) and with consulting engagements. For example, prior to the COVID pandemic, I
completed a yearlong engagement serving as the interim Chief Marketing Officer for Andrew
Harper’s Hideaway Report. And a few years before that, I launched my own entrepreneurial
venture, GayFamilyTrips.com.
My personal interests include travel, outdoor fitness (running, hiking, bicycling, paddling and
swimming), cooking, reading, and listening to music.

Important Notifications
Statement on Learning Success
Your success in this class is important to me. We will all need accommodations because we all
learn differently. If there are aspects of this course that prevent you from learning or exclude
you, please let me know as soon as possible. Together we’ll develop strategies to meet both your
needs and the requirements of the course. I also encourage you to reach out to the student
resources available through UT.
Policy on Scholastic Dishonesty
The McCombs School of Business has no tolerance for acts of scholastic dishonesty. The
responsibilities of both students and faculty with regard to scholastic dishonesty are described in
detail in the BBA Program’s Statement on Scholastic Dishonesty at
http://my.mccombs.utexas.edu/BBA/Code-of-Ethics. By teaching this course, I have agreed to
observe all faculty responsibilities described there. By enrolling in this class, you have agreed to
observe all student responsibilities described there. If the application of the Statement on
Scholastic Dishonesty to this class or its assignments is unclear in any way, it is your responsibility
to ask me for clarification. Students who violate University rules on scholastic dishonesty are
subject to disciplinary penalties, including the possibility of failure in the course and/or dismissal
from the University. Since dishonesty harms the individual, all students, the integrity of the
University, and the value of our academic brand, policies on scholastic dishonesty will be strictly
enforced. You should refer to the Student Conduct and Academic Integrity website at
http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/conduct/ to access the official University policies and
procedures on scholastic dishonesty as well as further elaboration on what constitutes scholastic
dishonesty.
Online Instruction
Getting Help with Zoom
Students needing help with Zoom should refer to the McCombs Student Instructional Wiki for a set
of comprehensive instructions. All McCombs Canvas course pages have this link on the left menu
bar for quick and easy reference.
UT Zoom Account
All students must use a UT Zoom account in order to participate in classes, office hours, and any
UT affiliated events. For detailed instructions on how to sign up for a UT Zoom account, see
Getting Started with Zoom. You will be denied access to Zoom sessions if you attempt to access
without a valid UT account.
Joining a Class or Office Hours in Zoom
The preferred method of joining a class or office hours is through Canvas. Students must log into
their Canvas course site and click on Zoom on the left menu bar to locate links to join the class in
Zoom in the calendar on Canvas. Zoom links for a class or office hours may also be emailed by the
instructor. Regardless, students must use their UT Zoom account to participate. For more
information, see How to Join Class or Office Hours.
Zoom Professionalism and Etiquette
Following are some best practices for making sure we are working together to create an efficient,
effective, respectful, and ultimately enjoyable classroom when accessing remotely:

Prof. Steve Brister MKT 372 Brand Management (#05955) 10
• Keep your video on at all times.
• Be mindful of your surroundings when on camera to minimize distractions.
• Avoid display of inappropriate materials or expressions, either visual, textual, or otherwise.
Such displays may be subject to disciplinary action.
• Turn your camera off when leaving the meeting temporarily and use the away feedback
icon.
• Include a professional photo of yourself for your Zoom profile picture. This photo will be
visible during class sessions if you keep your video off.
• Mute yourself unless you are speaking. This will reduce background or feedback noise and
limit distractions.
• Pose questions or comments using the “raise” your hand feature or typing in the chat
window. Try to keep questions and comments brief, especially in large classes.
• Turn off your video if the video or audio is choppy. After the class or meeting, try these
these Internet Connection Tips.
• Use the most reliable WIFI you can access. If you are experiencing problems with your
internet connection, here are some Internet Connection Tips.
For more information, please see Zoom Etiquette.
Class Recording Privacy
Class recordings are reserved only for students in this class for educational purposes and are
protected under FERPA. The recordings should not be shared outside the class in any form.
Violation of this restriction by a student could lead to Student Misconduct proceedings.
Sharing of Course Materials is Prohibited
No materials used in this class, including, but not limited to, lecture hand-outs, videos,
assessments (quizzes, exams, papers, projects, homework assignments), in-class materials,
review sheets, and additional problem sets, may be shared online or with anyone outside of the
class without explicit, written permission of the instructor. Unauthorized sharing of materials
promotes cheating. It is a violation of the University’s Student Honor Code and an act of
academic dishonesty. The University is well aware of the sites used for sharing materials, and
any materials found on such sites that are associated with a specific student, or any suspected
unauthorized sharing of materials, will be reported to Student Conduct and Academic Integrity in
the Office of the Dean of Students. These reports can result in sanctions, including failure of the
course.
McCombs Classroom Professionalism Policy
The highest professional standards are expected of all members of the McCombs community. The
collective class reputation and the value of the Texas BBA experience hinges on this. You should
treat the Texas BBA classroom as you would a professional corporate environment.
Faculty are expected to be professional and prepared to deliver value for each and every class
session. Students are expected to be professional in all respects. The Texas BBA classroom
experience is enhanced when:
• Students arrive on time. On time arrival ensures that classes are able to start and finish at
the scheduled time. On time arrival shows respect for both fellow students and faculty and
it enhances learning by reducing avoidable distractions.

Prof. Steve Brister MKT 372 Brand Management (#05955) 11
• Students display their name cards. This permits fellow students and faculty to learn names,
enhancing opportunities for community building and evaluation of in-class contributions.
• Students are fully prepared for each class. Much of the learning in the Texas BBA program
takes place during classroom discussions. When students are not prepared, they cannot
contribute to the overall learning process. This affects not only the individual, but their
peers who count on them, as well.
• Students respect the views and opinions of their colleagues. Disagreement and debate are
encouraged. Intolerance for the views of others is unacceptable.
• Students attend the class section to which they are registered. Learning is enhanced when
class sizes are optimized. Limits are set to ensure a quality experience and safety.
• Technology is used to enhance the class experience. When students are surfing the web,
responding to e-mail, instant messaging each other, and otherwise not devoting their full
attention to the topic at hand they are doing themselves and their peers a major disservice.
Those around them face additional distraction. Fellow students cannot benefit from the
insights of the students who are not engaged. Faculty office hours are spent going over
class material with students who chose not to pay attention, rather than truly adding value
by helping students who want a better understanding of the material or want to explore
the issues in more depth. Students with real needs may not be able to obtain adequate
help if faculty time is spent repeating what was said in class. There are often cases where
learning is enhanced by the use of technology in class. Faculty will let you know when it is
appropriate.
• Phones and wireless devices are turned off. We’ve all heard the annoying ringing in the
middle of a meeting. Not only is it not professional, it cuts off the flow of discussion when
the search for the offender begins. When a true need to communicate with someone
outside of class exists (e.g., for some medical need) please inform the professor prior to
class.
Diversity and Inclusion
It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well served by this
course, that students’ learning needs be addressed and that the diversity that students bring to
this class can be comfortably expressed and be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit to all
students. Please come to me at any time with any concerns.
Personal Pronoun Preference
Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals and
topics dealing with differences of race, culture, religion, politics, sexual orientation, gender,
gender variance, and nationalities. Class rosters are provided to the instructor with the student’s
legal name. I will gladly honor your request to address you by a name different than what
appears on the roster, and by the gender pronouns you use. Please advise me of this preference
early in the semester so that I may make appropriate changes to my records.
Student Rights & Responsibilities
• You have a right to a learning environment that supports mental and physical wellness.
• You have a right to respect.
• You have a right to be assessed and graded fairly.
• You have a right to freedom of opinion and expression.
• You have a right to privacy and confidentiality.

Prof. Steve Brister MKT 372 Brand Management (#05955) 12
• You have a right to meaningful and equal participation, to self-organize groups to improve
your learning environment.
• You have a right to learn in an environment that is welcoming to all people. No student
shall be isolated, excluded or diminished in any way.
With these rights come responsibilities:
• You are responsible for taking care of yourself, managing your time, and communicating
with the teaching team and with others if things start to feel out of control or
overwhelming.
• You are responsible for acting in a way that is worthy of respect and always respectful of
others.
• Your experience with this course is directly related to the quality of the energy that you
bring to it, and your energy shapes the quality of your peers’ experiences.
• You are responsible for creating an inclusive environment and for speaking up when
someone is excluded.
• You are responsible for holding yourself accountable to these standards, holding each
other to these standards, and holding the teaching team accountable as well.
Religious Holy Days
By UT Austin policy, you must notify me of your pending absence at least fourteen days prior to
the date of observance of a religious holy day. If you must miss a class, an examination, a work
assignment, or a project in order to observe a religious holy day, you will be given an opportunity
to complete the missed work within a reasonable time after the absence.
University Resources For Students
Your success in this class is important to me. We will all need accommodations because we all
learn differently. If there are aspects of this course that prevent you from learning or exclude you,
please let me know as soon as possible. Together we’ll develop strategies to meet both your needs
and the requirements of the course. There is also a range of resources on campus:
Services for Students with Disabilities
This class respects and welcomes students of all backgrounds, identities, and abilities. If there are
circumstances that make our learning environment and activities difficult, if you have medical
information that you need to share with me, or if you need specific arrangements in case the
building needs to be evacuated, please let me know. I am committed to creating an effective
learning environment for all students, but I can only do so if you discuss your needs with me as
early as possible. I promise to maintain the confidentiality of these discussions. If appropriate, also
contact Services for Students with Disabilities, 512-471-6259 (voice) or (512) 410-6644 (video
phone).
Counseling and Mental Health Center
Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising, avoiding drugs
and alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve your
goals and cope with stress. All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not
alone. There are many helpful resources available on campus and an important part of the college

Prof. Steve Brister MKT 372 Brand Management (#05955) 13
experience is learning how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is often
helpful. If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or
feelings like anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support. A Counselors in
Academic Residence (CARE) Program is available in each college from the Counseling and Mental
Health Center.
The Sanger Learning Center
Did you know that more than one-third of UT undergraduate students use the Sanger Learning
Center each year to improve their academic performance? All students are welcome to take
advantage of Sanger Center’s classes and workshops, private learning specialist appointments,
peer academic coaching, and tutoring for more than 70 courses in 15 different subject areas. For
more information, please visit Sanger Learning Center or call 512-471-3614 (JES A332).
Student Emergency Services
UT’s Student Emergency Services provides assistance, intervention, and referrals to support
students navigating challenging or unexpected issues that impact their well-being and academic
success. If you need to be absent from class due to a family emergency, medical or mental health
concern, or academic difficulty due to crisis or an emergency situation, please register with
Student Emergency Services. SES will verify your situation and notify your professors.
Important Safety Information
If you have concerns about the safety or behavior of fellow students, TAs or Professors, call BCCAL
(the Behavior Concerns and COVID-19 Advice Line): 512-232-5050. Your call can be anonymous. If
something doesn’t feel right – it probably isn’t. Trust your instincts and share your concerns.
Classroom Safety And COVID-19
To help preserve our in-person learning environment, the university recommends the following.
• Adhere to university mask guidance.
• Vaccinations are widely available, free and not billed to health insurance. The vaccine will
help protect against the transmission of the virus to others and reduce serious symptoms
in those who are vaccinated.
• Proactive Community Testing remains an important part of the university’s efforts to
protect our community. Tests are fast and free.
• Visit protect.utexas.edu for more information.
Title IX Reporting
Title IX is a federal law that protects against sex and gender-based discrimination, sexual
harassment, sexual assault, sexual misconduct, dating/domestic violence and stalking at federally
funded educational institutions. UT Austin is committed to fostering a learning and working
environment free from discrimination in all its forms. When sexual misconduct occurs in our
community, the university can:
1. Intervene to prevent harmful behavior from continuing or escalating.
2. Provide support and remedies to students and employees who have experienced harm or
have become involved in a Title IX investigation.
3. Investigate and discipline violations of the university’s relevant policies.

Prof. Steve Brister MKT 372 Brand Management (#05955) 14
Faculty members and certain staff members are considered “Responsible Employees” or
“Mandatory Reporters,” which means that they are required to report violations of Title IX to the
Title IX Coordinator. I am a Responsible Employee and must report any Title IX-related incidents
that are disclosed in writing, discussion, or one-on-one. Before talking with me or with any faculty
or staff member about a Title IX-related incident, be sure to ask whether they are a responsible
employee. If you want to speak with someone for support or remedies without making an official
report to the university, email advocate@austin.utexas.edu For more information about reporting
