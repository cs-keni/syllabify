Academic Honesty Policy
The following guideline to students has been recommended to the computer science
faculty and will apply to this class: "The University and the Department are committed to
preserving the reputation of your degree. It means a lot to you. In order to guarantee that
ev ery degree means what it says it means, we must enforce a strict policy on academic
honesty: Every piece of work that you turn in with your name on it must be yours and
yours alone. No co-working is allowed on any test, project, or homework assignment
unless explicitly allowed by an instructor in a particular class. You are responsible for
enforcing this policy in two ways: 1) You must not turn in work that is not yours, except
as expressly permitted by the instructor of each course. 2) You must not enable someone
else to turn in work that is not theirs. Do not share your work with anyone else. Make
sure that you adequately protect all your files. Even after you have finished a class, do not
share your work or published answers with the students who come after you. They need
to do their work on their own."
