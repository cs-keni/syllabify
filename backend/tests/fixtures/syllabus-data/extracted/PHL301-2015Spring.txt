PHILOSOPHY 301: INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY
Spring 2015 TTH 12:30-2:00 CAL 100
Bertrand Russell, a famous twentieth century British philosopher, once remarked that “the
point of philosophy is to start with something so simple as to seem not worth stating, and to end
with something so paradoxical that no one will believe it.” Whether or not Russell was right
about the point of philosophy, his aphorism correctly describes what happens in many
philosophy classrooms, including, as you’ll see, our own.

What To Expect in This Course
The purpose of this course is twofold: (1) to inculcate a desire to ponder philosophical
questions and (2) to deliver the philosophical skills necessary to begin answering those
questions. In service of these goals, we will conduct a survey of important philosophical
literature from the last 2500 years. We will examine the writing of Plato, St. Augustine,
Descartes, and Hume, as well as modern authors engaged in the same philosophical
enterprise. We will ask questions such as: What is knowledge, and how much do we know? What is
the appropriate relationship between a citizen and the state? What is the nature of time? Does God exist?
Philosophy is difficult. Really difficult. We are going to try to wrap our heads around some
radically complex ideas this semester. It’s natural for students—even bright students—to
struggle at times. In fact, if you’re not struggling at times, you’re probably not doing
philosophy properly. Try to savor this struggle—it’s what makes philosophy both fun and
infuriating.
And remember, this is a shared struggle. Ludwig Wittgenstein, another famous 20th century
philosopher, observed that “a philosopher who is not taking part in discussions is like a
boxer who never goes into the ring.” Willingness to speak up, both in lecture and in section,
will be crucial to your success. When clarification is needed (and, oh boy, clarification is
definitely going to be needed), ask for clarification! Someone else almost certainly shares your
question. We’re all in this together, so we’ve got to help each other out.
Assessment
Your grade will be determined by a weighted combination of the five assessments below:
1st Paper: 20% (due Feb 20th at 11:59 pm)
2nd Paper: 25% (due Mar 27th at 11:59 pm)
3rd Paper: 30% (due May 8th at 11:59 pm)
Final Exam: 15% (May 18th at 9:00 am)
Participation: 10%
Paper submissions will be entirely online, via Canvas. Late papers will be docked ⅓ of a
letter grade for each day after deadline. More details about the papers and the exam will be
presented as the relevant dates approach.
The numerical grade scale for the course is as follows:
100-94 = A 79.9-77 = C+ 63.9-60 = D-
93.9-90 = A- 76.9-74 = C 59.9 - 0 = F
89.9-87 = B+ 73.9-70 = C-
86.9-84 = B 69.9-67 = D+
83.9-80 = B- 66.9-64 = D

Course Website
canvas.utexas.edu
Canvas is your friend. A copy of this syllabus is already there. So are the required readings
which can’t be found in our course texts. As the semester progresses, I’ll also be posting my
PowerPoint slides there, and (for the ambitious among you) some interesting secondary
reading. When the TAs and I need to communicate with you, we’ll do so via Canvas. You’ll
also be uploading your papers to Canvas. It’s worth the time to familiarize yourself with the
site’s features now so that when you need to use it, you’re not completely lost.
Attendance Policy
Attendance at lecture and section is mandatory. Attendance will be taken during every lecture.
All students receive one free unexcused absence. After that, unexcused absences will cost
you one point off your final grade. Excuses must be cleared with your TA prior to lecture
(except in the case of emergencies). Be prepared to supply documentation to support your
excuse.
Documented Disability Statement
Students with disabilities may request appropriate academic accommodations from the
Division of Diversity and Community Engagement, Services for Students with Disabilities at
471-6259 (voice) or 232-2937 (video phone) or http://ddce.utexas.edu/disability/.
A Reminder about Academic Honesty
UT’s honor code reads:
The core values of The University of Texas at Austin are learning, discovery, freedom, leadership, individual
opportunity, and responsibility. Each member of the university is expected to uphold these values through
integrity, honesty, trust, fairness, and respect toward peers and community.
Plagiarism is the act of presenting someone else’s words or ideas as if they were your own.
Plagiarism of any kind is a major violation of the honor code and will not be tolerated. If
you are unsure how to properly cite your sources, please consult myself or your TAs.
Tentative Schedule of Readings and Topics
The pace of the course and the topics covered will be determined in part by the interest level
and understanding of the class. This schedule is a rough outline, not a firm plan. To stay
current with the reading assignments, you will need to attend class regularly. Assigned
reading should be completed before lecture on the assigned day.
