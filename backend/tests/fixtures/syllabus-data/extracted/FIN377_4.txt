COURSE OVERVIEW:
Financial Analysis is designed for finance majors in order to improve their skills at analyzing companies
and to advance their knowledge of finance theory and application. The overall financial analysis
includes: bond and stock valuation, financial statement and financial ratio analysis, EPS forecast,
discounted cash flow and adjusted present value modeling, and multiples valuation. In the two
simulations, students will grow and value a start-up, and forecast the synergies of a merger and
acquisitions. We also analyze valuation of an initial public offering and a leveraged buyout. The course
is quantitative and analytical in nature; we take theory and apply it to real world situations. Students
calculate and interpret financial data, build spreadsheet models, and make general conclusions about the
financial health of a company and its intrinsic value.
In this course a combination of methods is utilized with special emphasis on student involvement and
teamwork. The professor reviews terms and theory, asks questions, demonstrates techniques, assigns
problems and guides students in their case preparation. Students take a very active part in this class;
students complete finance simulations, and prepare two presentations. Learning takes place both inside
and outside the classroom. The emphasis on student involvement encourages students to learn by doing
and encourages the self-motivation so important to the workplace.
The course concludes with current case study application on different types of companies in a variety of
industry groups. By this time students will be formed into groups of perhaps three to five members.
Students implement valuation models to determine “fair value” for a company’s stock. In debate
fashion, students present their financial analysis and argue that the stock is currently priced correctly or
alternatively overvalued (undervalued). The WSJ (interactive edition) and market data from the financial
center will be important sources of information for student learning and research. Most groups get along
well with the usual “bumps in the road.” More serious problems shall be brought to the attention of the
professor.

EXPECTATIONS: PROFESSIONAL CLASSROOM & GROUP CONDUCT:
Professional behavior is expected in the classroom and will help us have a rewarding and enjoyable
learning experience. Arriving on time, excellent attendance, being attentive and participating are all
essential for the success of the class. When class starts, all of us will cease side conversations and focus
time allotted on classroom material. Electronic devices are prohibited during class; this includes
checking text messages under backpacks or your desk. Computers are used only if required by professor
during part or all of a class. Two combinations of the following will count as a zero for the day: using
electronic devices, late arrival to class, leaving or walking around during class, and leaving prior to the
end of class. In order for an absence to be marked as excused, you will need to send me the original
email regarding an interview or some sort of an attachment via email. If the absence meets the
university requirements for an excused absence, then it will be recorded as excused. It is up to you to
manage your schedule and arrive on time so as to keep excused absences to three or fewer over the term.
If you wish to have one unexcused absence for reasons not covered under university policy, then keep
excused absences down to two or fewer.
Also, you are expected to attend and arrive on time to group meetings and contribute in a meaningful
and productive way to all group work. If a student is not able to meet his or her commitments, the other
group members shall notify the professor as soon as possible. In accordance with academic integrity,
students may not earn credit for work to which they have not contributed at a reasonable level; if
someone in your group has not contributed at a meaningful level, leave his or her name off the project
or presentation and then email me to call my attention to the issue. Once I am aware of the issue, the
student may be redirected, receive partial or zero credit, and / or be permitted to do the group work as a
single student. Adherence to the above expectations regarding professional behavior helps ensure a high
participation / evaluation grade. Inability to meet these expectations will lead to a lowering of the final
participation / evaluation grade.
EVALUATION: Final grades will be determined as follows:
In-Class Assignments (Individual) / Attendance 10%
Many days the professor will give students in-class assignments, often Excel models, which the
instructor helps lead students through. Though each student must complete his or her own work,
students should in fact work in a collaborative fashion and help one another.
Assignments are due by canvas upload at the end of class (although occasionally or possibly on occasion
turned in hard copy). The professor will drop the lowest grade (or possibly two depending on the
3

number assigned). The student should save his or her completed spreadsheet prior to upload and name
the file, if possible, by last name. Do not ask to use another student’s work nor send your completed file
to another student.
The grading scheme is as follows:
In class, submitted on time, best effort basis, (defined as about 80% or more correct) = full credit
In class, submitted up to a day late, best effort basis, (defined as about 80% or more correct) = 80%
Not in class, submitted on time, best effort basis, (defined as about 80% or more correct) = 70%
Not in class, submitted up to a day late, best effort basis, (defined as about 80% or more correct) = 60%
Up to 2 days late = 40%; later than that no credit
Not completed on best efforts basis or not very well done = 40%
Post blank spreadsheet = 0 (and possible 50% reduction on next posting)
Shared or used someone else’s spreadsheet = zero not just for assignment but for entire category
If a case discussion short paper is assigned prior to a class, similar policies will apply in terms of
evaluation.
Two Simulation Projects with Exhibits and Write-Up (Individual or Pairs) 20%
As an individual or in pairs (under no circumstance may there may be more than two people), students
will complete two on-line finance simulations. The first is called “Working Capital: Managing
Growth” and the second is titled “Merger and Acquisition in Wine Country”. In Working Capital:
Managing Growth, students take on the role of entrepreneurs / executives managing growth of a start-up.
Students evaluate projects based on revenue growth, working capital required, and most importantly
cash flow effects. After making decisions you believe will add value to the firm, you next analyze the
effect of growth on financial ratios. In the “Merger and Acquisition in Wine Country” Simulation,
individuals or student pairs (under no circumstance may there may be more than two people) are
assigned one of three roles; there are two mid-sized wine companies, which could merge, and a larger
company that may acquire one of the other two companies. Each party receives information regarding
the range of estimated synergies of a merger or acquisition and run DCF and APV analyses to determine
the estimate of value created. Next, you enter reservation prices and negotiate the deal seeing stock price
effects of the negotiation.
After the simulation is completed, students write a 5 to 6 page paper with 10 to 12 exhibit pages
attached. Individual students are encouraged to submit 5 written pages with 10 exhibit pages while
pairs are encouraged to submit 6 written pages with 12 exhibit pages. Also pairs must submit self and
peer evaluations on canvas. If you are in a pair and the other student has not contributed at about 40%
or more of the final product, then you should inform the professor and the partner that you will submit
separately (which includes not sharing exhibit work). The paper is graded on strength of analysis,
modeling and professional nature of exhibits, and how well it is written. For additional information, see
the posted documents about the papers.
Two Tests (Individual Grade) and Relation to Problem Sets 35%
There will be two tests; each test will have a multiple choice section counting for about 40% of the
grade and a problem solving / analysis / short essay counting for about 60% of the grade. Tests are
equally weighted. The tests will evaluate students’ understanding of the material covered to date. The
tests primarily cover material only in that unit; to the degree that the material builds the tests include
such material. The in-class tests include theory and case questions, problems requiring application and
interpretation (including working with a spreadsheet, financial statement, or handout). Though the
problem set may not be collected and graded, many of the short problems and analysis are related to
4

your successful completion of the problem set which is posted on-line with the solutions. Think of the
problem set as a type of practice test for the problem section of the test. On test day, you should arrive 5
to 10 minutes early if possible, and bring a financial calculator, a pencil and one side of one page of
notes. The one-sided page should be handwritten with any tips, formulas or short examples that are
helpful to you but shall not include long portions of copying; the notes page is to help you learn and do
better on the test and not just copy and paste. In the case that a test is missed with an excused absence
approved by the Dean’s office, the student will take a cumulative final at the end of the term.
Two Presentations (Group Grade with Individual Component) 15%
Each group will present one case to the class. The presentation should be about 25-30 minutes.
Approach the case as though you were in a case competition and work through any analytical or
modeling issues proposed in the case. Primarily in your presentation, walk the class through the primary
points and issues in the case. Your goal is to educate your peers at a deeper level, walk them through
problems or Excel work, and engage the class in the analysis and problem solving. Materials shall be
emailed to me no later than 15 minutes prior to the start of class so that they can be posted on-line. Your
presentation and the power-point slides will be evaluated on: organization, accuracy, degree of interest,
professional appearance of power-point and excel, and communication skill.
The second presentation is given in the form of a debate. Two teams are assigned a particular stock.
One side presents financial models and information supporting the position that the stock is undervalued
and a “good buy.” Groups have PPTs for the opening arguments, one PPT for each of three possible
challenges so three PPTs for challenges, and PPTs for the closing arguments. Students shall use power-
point slides to outline their position and supporting evidence including qualitative evidence and
quantitative support (DCF and multiples-based valuation). Presentations will be graded on strength of
analysis, how interesting and persuasive, execution of valuation models, and presentation skills.
Academic honesty rules apply to presentations- in a group of four for example, each student should
contribute about 25% of the work. Most people in most groups contribute at an approximately equal
level to presentations, as evidenced by peer reviews, and earn the same grades but there are occasional
exceptions. If the professor determines that a student has contributed below the fair level the student
will likely be removed from the group and be permitted to write a 10-page makeup due a week after the
professor has informed said student, with a one letter grade downgrade. If the professor determines the
contribution level is low or variable among members, she will add an individual component with half of
the grade being based on the individual contribution and half on the group contribution.
Final Stock Valuation Paper or Presentation (Individual Grade): 10%
In place of a final exam, each student will individually analyze one company (to be announced by the
professor). Each student submits his or her own valuation models (two or more exhibit pages) and then
takes a buy or sell position on the stock. Students may either write a four to five page analysis of the
qualitative and quantitative reasons that the stock is a buy or sell or the student may record an
approximate 8 to 10 minute video of himself or herself presenting the analysis. If the paper is written,
the submission should be all in one: written paper, exhibits, works cited. If the analysis is verbal, then
upload two files – the presentation and a document of the exhibits and works cited. For more
information see the posted document.
5

Professor Evaluation / Participation & Peer Review (Individual Grade) 10%
Class participation is based on the contribution of each student to the class as a whole and to the group
efforts. Solid performance in this area depends on: consistent attendance; being actively engaged when
we are doing in-class assignments, demonstration that you are prepared for class; effort level toward
group papers and presentations; strong reviews by peers in their evaluations; and adherence to class
policies (see below for class policies including prohibition of improper use of electronics during class).
To be prepared for class, read the case prior to class. Also take an active part in case analyses in class
by giving your answer or opinion, solving problems, and suggesting solutions. Also submitting required
peer reviews helps you with participation while failing to submit your self and peer reviews leads to a 20
point downgrade for each one not submitted.
For most students, participation serves as a slight curve toward the final grade. After all components
prior to this one have been scored, the grades are combined to provide an “objective average” or
“starting point” grade for participation. Students with strong attendance, professional conduct and
committed participation in group work will receive this grade or higher (up to a letter grade) for the
participation grade. Strong attendance is defined as attending ninety percent or more of class periods
unless excused by university policy*; ninety percent or better attendance equates to three or fewer
absences. A student with poor attendance (missing more than 20% of class periods—six or more
classes), or poor effort in group work, or anyone who is disruptive / unprofessional earns a zero. Thus
the grade in this final category may range from zero to a grade of A or 96 or perhaps higher. The vast
majority of students—those with good class performance and solid participation, receive an A or B for
the participation curve. This last component, if high, tends to help students on the borderline—for
example a grade of 79 prior to participation will likely result in a final grade of an 80.
*Any two combinations of the following will count as an absence: using electronics, late arrival to
class, leaving during class, leaving prior to the end of class. Students who attend 90% or better are
entitled to any curve if one is needed in the class; those with lower attendance than 90% do not qualify
for any potential curve.
Final Letter Grades
Final letter grades will be determined so that a class G.P.A. of approximately 3.4 is obtained. This
G.P.A. is within the recommendations provided by the UPO office and the department of finance
curriculum committee. Let me give you a general idea of what such a G.P.A. could imply. If about 40%
of the class were assigned grades distributed equally over A- and A and about 60% of the class were
assigned grades of B+, B, and B-, then the class average G.P.A. would be almost a 3.4. The instructor
for the course does not, though, necessarily adhere to a specific percentage breakdown of A, A-, B+, B,
B-, C+ and the like. Since this is an elective course, most terms very few students earn grades in the C,
D or F range but it does happen. Usually these are cases of poor peer evaluations, poor attendance, and
missed work. Thus the example given was for illustrative purposes to help you understand one way a
3.4 average G.P.A. might be achieved. Since class grades will be assigned based on this method and no
number cutoffs are given, the professor for the course will attempt to post on occasion approximate
grade cutoffs. Soon after grades for the first short paper and first test have been posted, the professor
will share with the class what the grade assignments would be if given on that day. This information is
for illustrative purposes and so that students may get a general sense of where they stand in terms of
evaluation. Note again, the guidelines posted are general and apply only to those who have strong
6

participation and peer review. If an upward curve is needed on tests or final grades, only those with
strong attendance and peer evaluation are eligible to receive the curve. Grade assignments and cutoffs
may change by the end of the term depending on new items submitted.
Deviations from Academic Honesty / Not Pulling Weight in Groups and Negative Effect on Grades
Deviations from Academic Honesty on a test or on a paper will be forwarded to the Dean of Students
office with a recommendation of zero on the item in question and the penalty of another full letter
downgrade in the student’s final average. Since academic dishonesty cases are not tolerated and result
in clear downgrades, it is worth me reminding you that guessing on a test (or turning a paper in late and
taking a downgrade) is a much better option than academic dishonesty.
Students are expected to contribute in an approximately equal fashion to all group assignments. In a
group of four, for example, it may not be the case that everyone contributes exactly equally at 25% of
the final product on a particular assignment. If, however, a group member contributes either nothing or
does contribute something but it is small relative to peers, then academic integrity would require you to
do two things: one, leave that student’s name off the work and two, send an email to the instructor
notifying her of the situation. This includes presentations and / or debates. The instructor for the course
most often will decide to remove a student from a group if the group is experiencing challenges. In the
case of little or no contribution, the student may receive a zero or she or he may be permitted to do the
entire project on his own with a letter downgrade.
Various Class Policies
Electronics—I follow the department of finance policy on the use of electronics in class. This policy
states that use of any electronic advices or tools (laptops, cell phones, etc.) during class is prohibited
unless specifically requested by the professor of the class. This means that laptops are closed and all
other devices are put away prior to the start of class; students shall not initiate nor receive text messages
during class nor have phones out charging during class. If we need computers for class, the professor
will at times permit computer use and at other times require computers closed or turned off. Adherence
to this policy facilitates the students’ abilities to process class material and helps lead to a solid
participation grade; failure to follow the policy disrupts the class and leads to a poor participation grade.
Test Times-- I adopt class policies that encourage students to keep up on material such that with
attendance and solid time management, students should find themselves adequately prepared to be able
to study and take exams. You are required to take exams at the scheduled date unless you have a
university excused absence. If you know you will have a university excused absence, contact me ahead
of time to see if something can be arranged prior to take the test early. Submit documentation to verify.
No make-up exam is offered after the test. If you miss an exam and have a university excused absence,
you will be offered a cumulative exam at the end of the term.
Test Review after the Test— Once tests are graded and ready to be reviewed, I will have a three week
period when you may review your test during office hours. To be able to review your test, please stop by
during that time frame.
Accommodations—I follow the university policy on special accommodations and am happy to work
with you on this matter. At the beginning of the term or prior to the first major project or test, please
submit to me a letter prepared by the Service office listed above. Then, email three business days ahead
7

of the scheduled test reminding me of the nature of the accommodation and the time that you can start
(keeping in mind you must end by 4:30pm) so that we can make arrangements.
Attendance at your section – You are required to attend your own section. Attendance at the other
section is not permitted. One exception to this rule is allowed per term (per student) if the student
submits a request prior to the class and the instructor is able to accommodate the request. No guarantees
are made on accommodating such a request since most days require attendance at your section.
Documenting a family emergency—The office of the Dean of Students is able to provide student
services that can assist you in the event of a family emergency. To get that assistance and to document
that situation with me as your faculty member, look at the following web address for how to proceed:
deanofstudents.utexas.edu/emergency/.
Late Work and Presentation Arrival– The policy on work submitted late for major work (projects,
papers, peer evaluations, etc.): 1 second to 10 minutes late = -8 points; 10 minutes to 20 minutes = -15;
after 20 minutes email professor regarding issue and intended turn in, 20 minute mark to 1 day = -25;
each day later than 24 hours = original -25 plus -15 for each day.
