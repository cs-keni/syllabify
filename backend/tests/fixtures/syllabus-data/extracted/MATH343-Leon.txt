Prerequisites: MATH 252
Important Note:
• Students who already have credit for MATH 462 cannot get credit for
MATH 343.
• Students who take 343 and 462 concurrently cannot get credit for 343.
• Students who have credit for 343 can later take 462 and get credit, but the
two courses cannot both be used to satisfy the “four upper-division course”
requirement for the Math Major.
Text: ”Statistics for the Sciences”, by Buntinas and Funk.
Other Recommended Materials: A scientific or graphing calculator. Colored
pens or pencils.
Calculators: Calculatorscanbehelpfulforhomeworkandactuallymaybeneeded
for some of the problems. No calculators will be allowed during exams (unless oth-
erwise stated).
Course Content: We will (most likely) do a selection of topics from chapters
1-10, if time allows.
Learning Outcomes:
By the end of the course, the successful student will have knowledge of the ba-
sic tools of statistics and a certain knowledge of probability theory necessary to
understand basic models and tests used in statistics.
In particular, the student will be expected to understand the notion of random
variable and their mass/density functions and distribution functions, as well as
typical types of random variables used in statistics, for instance: Bernoulli, bi-
nomial, uniform, exponential and Gaussian random variables. Additionally, the
student will be expected to know certain quantities attached to random variables,
for instance mean, variance and percentiles, their probabilistic interpretation, and
how to estimate these quantities from data.

The statistical content of the course will revolve mostly around modeling and
hypothesis testing. The successful student will have an understanding of what
types of standard random variables are applicable in various situations/models,
and in some instances what assumptions/simplifications are necessary to model
certain situations by a particular type of random variable. The student will be
able to form hypotheses from simple data, and know various methods (tests) to
confirm/reject a hypothesis within a certain confidence interval under various as-
sumptions on the data. The student should come away with an understanding of
how these methods will scale to actual data sets which may arise in the sciences
or other disciplines.
Canvas:
Atcanvas.uoregon.edu you mayloginand accesscoursedocuments such asthis syl-
labus. In-Depth homework will be posted there. Also, you may view your scores
on homework and tests at any time. Hence, check it periodically for homework
assignments, announcements, and to see if your assignment scores are properly
entered in the grade book.
CommunicationOurclasswillcommunicatethroughourCanvassite. Announce-
ments and emails are archived there and automatically forwarded to your UO
email, and can even reach you by text. Check and adjust your settings under
Account → Notifications.
If you contact me with a question, I will try to respond within one business day.
I typically provide feedback on assignments graded by me within one week.
Course grade determined by:
• Homework + WebWork 25%
• Midterm Exams 25% each
• Final exam 25%
Standard grade assignments will be made (e.g. grades in the 80% to 90% range
will be B’s, those in the 70% to 80% range are C, etc.) Plus and minus grades
will be awarded in the upper and lower 2% of a bracket. (e.g. A grade of B+ is
awarded between 88% and 90%; B- between 80% and 82%). I reserve the right to
apply a course adjustment to grades at the end of the term. Being active in class,
might be taken into the account while considering “boundary cases”.

In-depth Homework:
There will be some conceptual homework covering some in-depth problems. As-
signments will be posted on Canvas every Wednesday (starting Week 2) and must
be uploaded into Canvas, till 11:59pm the following Wednesday. Homework should
be in ONE FILE, legible, complete and self-contained. That is, a reader should be
able to understand exactly what you are trying to demonstrate (be it a problem or

a proof) without referring to any additional resource. The homework assignments
will be posted on the Canvas webpage for the course and submitted electronically
through Canvas. Possibly the easiest way to create a file for submission is to neatly
write your homework solutions and then use a smart phone to create a single pdf of
the solutions. There are several scanning apps (like Genius Scan or CamScanner)
that can create a pdf. Note that cell phone images are rarely readable and usually
too large for Canvas submission. If you have difficulty scanning your homework
to create a pdf, please let me know as soon as possible. I highly recommend that
you begin the assignments the day that they are posted and work on them as we
are discussing the material during the week.
Homework uploaded up to 12 hours day after its original deadline will be graded
without penalty. The lowest in-depth homework score will be dropped.
Homework on WebWork:
A part of your homework will also be given and collected via WebWork. Web-
Work is a free, web browser-based program that maintains and grades a pool of
homework problems that have been selected by your instructor. You will usually
have a week for completing WW assignment, with two extra days of reduced scor-
ing (each problem done during that time will be worth 75% of its original value).
This applies to all but the “Orientation” set.
Each WeBWorK set will be available via assignments posted on Canvas. Your user
account in WeBWorK will be created the first time you use the link to WeBWorK
in a Canvas assignment. Moreover, in order for automatic grade pass back from
WeBWork to Canvas to work, you must use the link in the assignment at least one
time. Thus, please make sure that you use links attached to your assignments.
The lowest WebWork score will be dropped.
Logging Into WebWork:
Seehttps://uowebwork.uoregon.edu/webwork2/toaccessWebWorkassignments
for this class. Among sections of Math 343 you need to access YOURS according
to the CRN of the class in which you are enrolled. You will need to sign in using
your regular UofO email credentials: your DuckID as your username and your
UO email password for password. Once you have logged in, you can change your
password, if you wish.
WebWork Practice:
The first assignment you should complete in WebWork is called “Orientation”.
It does not involve (much) math, but instead is intended to familiarize you with
the interface of WebWork: how to look at problems, how to preview and enter
answers, and so on. This assignment counts as your first homework assignment.
Do it by the end of Friday night by 11:59pm on Week 1 for credit. These are
easy points! (if you used this system before, this set should take no more than 10
minutes).
Showing Work:
While doing your WeBWorK homework, I highly recommend having scratch
paperathand. EventhoughWeBWorKdoesnotgradeyouonyourprocess, having
a comprehensive thought process is necessary. It will also help you track down

mistakes that you made if the first answer you submit is incorrect. Remember:
On exams showing your work will be extremely important!
Getting Help:
If you have a question about a homework problem, one excellent resource is
the ”email instructor” button at the bottom of the page. Clicking on that and
typing a short message about what you have tried on the problem will help your
instructor diagnose the issue you are having. Please, do not send an email simply
saying ”What am I doing wrong on this problem?” or ”I can’t get the right answer
on this one”. On most homework problems it is impossible to figure out what
you are doing wrong if I only see your answer (which is all WebWork shows me).
Hence, first you should go back over your work and see if you can find the mistakes
yourself. If you can’t, feel free to email me, but include a description of how you
solved the problem as well as any work you did for intermediate steps. The more
information you give, the more likely it is you get a prompt and helpful reply.
Exams:
(1) Midterm Exams: Wednesdays of Week 5 and Week 8, during the class
(2) Final Exam: Monday, June 9, 2025, 2:45 p.m. (location TBA)
Bring your UO student ID to all your exams.
Theuseofcellularphones, oranydevicethatcommunicateswiththeoutsideworld
is strictly forbidden during exams.
Note, you are expected to make the given exam times. There are no makeup
exams. To accommodate for that, the lowest exam score is dropped. This means if
you miss an exam due to illness then than will be your dropped exam. This policy
is in place because “life happens”.
If you miss more than one exam, please note that I will not be able to drop
additional exams for any reason. All students must be treated equally regardless
of circumstances.
Accessibility:
For those of you who are currently registered with Accessible Education Center
for a documented disability, please present your paperwork to me during the first
week of the term so that we can design a plan for you. Those of you with a
disability (or who might) but are not registered with AEC should contact them
as soon as possible. It is much more likely that measures can be taken to provide
adequate special accommodation if the organization is done through AEC. I have
attempted to provide documents that are accessible. Please let me know if you
need additional accommodations.
Student Conduct:
I plan to treat every student with respect and, as such, expect my students to show
respect for me and for the class as a whole. Violations of the student conduct code
result in the incident being included on your student conduct record and can result
in a failing grade on any course work related to the violation or a failing grade in
thecourse. TheUniversityofOregonrequiresall instances ofcheatingbereported,
no matter how small.
Cheating includes, but is not limited to:
-Looking at another student’s exam during a test
-Copying the work of another person (student or otherwise) and submitting it as

your own
-Usinganymaterialsexceptthoseexplicitlyapprovedduringatest-takingsituation
-Resubmitting graded work that was altered after being returned
For a list of other descriptions of cheating, see the Student Conduct Code,
dos.uoregon.edu/conduct.
The University Student Conduct Code defines academic misconduct, which in-
cludes unauthorized help on assignments and examinations and the use of sources
without acknowledgment. Academic misconduct is prohibited at UO. Conse-
quencesofareportedmisconducttotheOfficeofStudentConductandCommunity
Standards can include failure of the course.
Calculator Policy:
Scientific and graphing calculators are good tools for learning, and some of the
homework problems use them. You are welcome to use calculators on homework.
But no calculators will be allowed on any of the exams in this course. Students
are expected to be able to perform basic arithmetic operations with fractions and
decimals by hand.
Suggestions for Successful Study:
Don’t get behind in your homework, reading, etc.
Participate in class, ask questions, and make use of my office hours.
Make friends with your classmates-you can find out for instance what material was
covered when you missed the class or discuss homework problems with them.
Read ahead in the book. Even reading the first few pages of each lesson will help
the material sink in quicker during lecture and allow you to ask meaningful ques-
tions.
Keep all your old homework assignments, midterms, and quizzes - most probably,
you will find them useful when you are studying for future tests.
