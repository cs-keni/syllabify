General Info:
MWF, 12:00 - 1:00
Burdine Hall, Room 108
Bio 336 - unique number 50115
Bio 391M - unique number 51120
Office Hours:
Tuesdays, 9:00 - 10:30
Fridays, 10:30 - 12:00
Final Exam: Thursday, May 12, 9:00-12:00 noon
Prerequisites for Bio 336 (for undergraduates):
Biology 325 (Genetics), and either Biology 330 (Animal Virology) or 360K
(Immunology), all with a grade of at least C.
Assigned Readings:
Readings will be assigned for each lecture and will consist primarily of
review papers taken from a variety of scientific journals (e.g., Cell,
Science, Nature, Nature Cancer Reviews, Oncogene, Seminars in
Cancer Biology).
All assigned reading will be freely available on the internet and links to
the readings and/or PDF files will be posted on this site. Some readings
will be from on-line textbooks, including Cancer Medicine.
While there is no required textbook, you are strongly encouraged to seek
out relevant texts as needed.
A very good recent textbook is Robert Weinberg's The Biology of
Cancer.

Some on-line textbooks that are very useful include:
Molecular Biology of the Cell (Alberts)
The Cell (Geoffrey Cooper)
Molecular Cell Biology (Lodish)
Retroviruses (Coffin, et al.)
Any good biochemistry text, such as Biochemistry (Stryer)
Any good genetics text such as Modern Genetic Analysis or
Introduction to Genetic Analysis
All of these are available to you fee of charge at BOOKS at
PubMed
Exams, Grading, Attendance: Grades will be based on three in-class exams and
a final exam (dates below). Final grade distributions will be adjusted (i.e., "curved")
based on overall class performance; grades for undergraduate (Bio 336) and
graduate (Bio 391M) sections will be determined separately. Attendance may be
taken periodically during the course and greater than three unexcused absences
may result in final grade penalty at the discretion of the instructor.
Exam 1: 100 points Feb. 16, in class.
Exam2: 100 points Mar. 23, in class.
Exam 3: 100 points Apr. 11, in class.
Final Exam: 200 points May 12, 9-12 am.
Total: 500 points*
Half of the final (100 points) will be from the last quarter of the class (the
material between the third exam and the end of the course), and half will
be cumulative over the entire course.
*In addition, up to three unannounced quizes may be given during the
semester. These will count for a maximum of 20 points each beyond
the 500 exam points.
