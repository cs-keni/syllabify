I. Course Objectives:
Overview:
In recent years, rapid developments in data collection and storage technologies have led to data
sets that are “big” in many senses of the word. Data mining is the automatic discovery of
interesting patterns and relationships in such “big data”. This undergraduate course will provide
an introduction to the topic of data mining, and some statistical principles underlying its key
methods. Topics covered will include data preprocessing, regression, classification, clustering,
dimensionality reduction, and association analysis.

II. Course Schedule (Tentative):
Note that these are tentative and are subject to minor changes (including homework release dates).

III. Course Requirements:

1. Course Readings/Materials:
Textbooks:
Introduction to Data Mining, by P. Tan, M. Steinbach, V. Kumar, Addison Wesley, 2006.
Textbook Website: http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~kumar/dmbook/index.php.
2. Assignments, Assessment, and Evaluation
a. Grading Policy:
1. 6 Homeworks (60%)
2. Exams
a. 1 Midterm (15%)
b. 1 Final: (25%)
b.Homework Policy: Each student is expected to submit an individually written homework. When using
information from papers, or other external sources, please cite this information. The homeworks will be be due the
beginning of class on the due date. There will be two “free” late days, that you could use either all on one
homework, or on two different homeworks. Otherwise, a homework will be worth 50% if one day late, and 0% if
it is two or more days late. It is required to submit all homeworks even if after two days, if you do not want an
incomplete grade.
c. Class attendance and participation policy:
I expect students to participate actively in the class.
IV. Academic Integrity
University of Texas Honor Code
Each student in this course is expected to abide by the University of Texas Honor Code.
The core values of The University of Texas at Austin are learning, discovery, freedom, leadership,
individual opportunity, and responsibility. Each member of the university is expected to uphold these values
through integrity, honesty, trust, fairness, and respect toward peers and community.
Collaboration Policy
You are encouraged to study together and to discuss information and concepts covered in lecture with
other students, especially on Piazza. However, this cooperation should never involve one student having
possession of a copy of all or part of work done by someone else.

Should copying occur, both the student who copied work from another student and the student who gave
material to be copied will both automatically receive a zero for the assignment. Penalty for violation of
this Code can also be extended to include failure of the course and University disciplinary action.
V. Other University Notices and Policies
Documented Disability Statement
Any student with a documented disability who requires academic accommodations should contact
Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD) at (512) 471-6259 (voice) or 1-866-329-3986 (video
phone). Faculty are not required to provide accommodations without an official accommodation letter
from SSD.
! Please notify me as quickly as possible if the material being presented in class is not accessible
(e.g., instructional videos need captioning, course packets are not readable for proper alternative
text conversion, etc.).
! Contact Services for Students with Disabilities at 471-6259 (voice) or 1-866-329-3986 (video
phone) or reference SSD’s website for more disability-related information: http://www.utexas.edu/
diversity/ddce/ssd/for_cstudents.php
Behavior Concerns Advice Line (BCAL)
If you are worried about someone who is acting differently, you may use the Behavior Concerns Advice
Line to discuss by phone your concerns about another individual’s behavior. This service is provided
through a partnership among the Office of the Dean of Students, the Counseling and Mental Health
Center (CMHC), the Employee Assistance Program (EAP), and The University of Texas Police
Department (UTPD). Call 512-232-5050 or visit http://www.utexas.edu/safety/bcal.
Q drop Policy
The State of Texas has enacted a law that limits the number of course drops for academic reasons to six
(6). As stated in Senate Bill 1231:
“Beginning with the fall 2007 academic term, an institution of higher education may not permit an
undergraduate student a total of more than six dropped courses, including any course a transfer student has
dropped at another institution of higher education, unless the student shows good cause for dropping more
than that number.”
Emergency Evacuation Policy
Occupants of buildings on the UT Austin campus are required to evacuate and assemble outside when a
fire alarm is activated or an announcement is made. Please be aware of the following policies regarding
evacuation:
! Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of the classroom and the building. Remember that the
nearest exit door may not be the one you used when you entered the building.

! If you require assistance to evacuate, inform me in writing during the first week of class.
! In the event of an evacuation, follow my instructions or those of class instructors.
Do not re-enter a building unless the Austin Fire Department, the UT Austin Police Department, or the
Fire Prevention Services office gives you instructions.
