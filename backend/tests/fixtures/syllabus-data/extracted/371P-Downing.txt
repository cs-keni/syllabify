Incompletes
To be eligible for an incomplete you must have a letter grade of C or better and a written,
verifiable excuse for missing the last test. This is a necessary but insufficient condition
for receiving an incomplete.
Academic Integrity
Students who violate University rules on academic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary
penalties, including the possibility of failure in the course and/or dismissal from the
University. Since such dishonesty harms the individual, all students, and the integrity of
the University, policies on academic dishonesty will be strictly enforced. For further
information please visit the Student Judicial Services Web site: Student Judicial
Services.
Programming assignments will be compared using Moss. You may share design ideas
with your fellow students. You may not share code in any way with your fellow students.
The penalty for academic dishonesty will be a course grade of F and a referral of the case
to the Dean of Students. Further penalties, including suspension or expulsion from the
university may be imposed by that office.
