Academic misconduct: The University Student Conduct Code (conduct.uoregon.edu)
defines academic misconduct. Students are prohibited from committing or attempting to
commit any act that constitutes academic misconduct. By way of example, students should
not give or receive (or attempt to give or receive) unauthorized help on assignments or
examinations without express permission from the instructor. Students should properly
acknowledge and document all sources of information (e.g. quotations, paraphrases, ideas)
and use only the sources and resources authorized by the instructor. If there is any question
about whether an act constitutes academic misconduct, it is the students’ obligation to
clarify the question with the instructor before committing or attempting to commit the
act. Additional information about a common form of academic misconduct, plagiarism, is
available at https://researchguides.uoregon.edu/citing-plagiarism.

Grading: A: 90% or more, B: 80%–89%, C: 70%–79%, D: 60%–69%, F: below 60%. Plus
grades will be awarded when the last digit is 8 or higher. Minus grades will be given if
the last digit is either a 0 or 1. Your final percentage will be rounded to the nearest whole
number. You must get at least 70% to receive a pass (P) grade if you are taking this course
with the Pass/No Pass option.
Attendance: Asignificantportionofyourgradewillcomefromattendingandparticipating
in class. You should plan to attend every single class. You are responsible for finding out
what you missed if you are unable to attend.

Course learning outcomes: Math 341 begins with the study of solving systems of
linear equations by manipulating vectors and matrices. Then it introduces properties of
matrices including operations, existence of an inverse, and determinants. The main goal
is the introduction of vector spaces and linear transformations defined by matrices. A
successful student in this course will be able to
1. Find the general solution of a system of linear equations using row reduction;
2. Express a system of linear equations as a matrix equation;
3. Determine whether a set of vectors is linearly independent or linearly dependent;
4. Use row operations to determine if a square matrix is invertible and then find its
inverse when it exists;
5. Find the determinant of a matrix by using a cofactor expansion or by performing row
operations;
6. Understand applications of the determinant including determining it a square matrix
is nonsingular and the geometric implications for vectors in R2 or R3;
7. Understand the definition of vector space, subspace, basis, and dimension;
8. Determine if a given vector lies in the span of a set of given vectors;
9. Find the dimension of a span of vectors;
10. Find the coordinates of a vector with respect to a given basis;
11. Find the null space and range of a linear transformation.
Weekly assignments, as well as problems on the midterm and final exam, will provide
students with opportunities to demonstrate the level of their abilities relative to the above
learning outcomes.
Daily homework: There will be daily homework except on Fridays. Each daily homework
will be relatively short; consists of 2-3 questions related the lecture of the same day. There
are in total sixteen daily homeworks, the lowest four will be dropped to accommodate
anyone missed a week of the class due to any reasons. Tests: There will be weekly test on
each Friday, each test covers all materials from the same week except for the last test; the
last test will be cumulative over all materials.

Tentative Reading Schedule: Below is a tentative schedule of which sections of the
textbook you are expected to read and when you are expected to read them. For example:
in week 2, we will discuss section 1.3 on Monday, section 1.4 on Wednesday, and 1.5 on
Friday.
Week Sections
1 1.1 - 1.9
2 2.1, 2.2,2.3,3.1
3 3.2, 3.3, 4.1,4.2,4.3
4 4.3 - 4.6
Grading Breakdown:
Daily homework 15%
Participation 5%
Weekly Exam 80%
Make-up and Extra Credit: Late homework will be penalized 10% per day. You may
unlock extra credit by typesetting all (or almost all) assignments in latex (see Canvas for
more resources). If you are unable to attend the midterm or quiz, the weight will be trans-
ferred onto the final exam. A missed final exam will likely result in an incomplete grade in
the class, and will require a make-up exam.
Important Dates:
• June 25 – last day to drop without a ‘W’
• June 25 – last day to add a class
• July 10 – last day to drop the course

What follows is a general description of various University of Oregon policies, not specific
to this course.
Academic Disruption due to Campus Emergency: In the event of a campus emer-
gency that disrupts academic activities, course requirements, deadlines, and grading per-
centages are subject to change. Information about changes in this course will be communi-
cated as soon as possible by email, and on Canvas. If we are not able to meet face-to-face,
students should immediately log onto Canvas and read any announcements and/or access
alternative assignments. Students are also expected to continue coursework as outlined in
this syllabus or other instructions on Canvas. In the event that the instructor of this course
has to quarantine, this course may be taught online during that time.
Academic Misconduct: The University Student Conduct Code, available at
https://conduct.uoregon.edu,
defines academic misconduct. Students are prohibited from committing or attempting to
commit any act that constitutes academic misconduct. By way of example, students should
not give or receive (or attempt to give or receive) unauthorized help on assignments or
examinations without express permission from the instructor. Students should properly
acknowledge and document all sources of information (e.g. quotations, paraphrases, ideas)
and use only the sources and resources authorized by the instructor. If there is any question
about whether an act constitutes academic misconduct, it is the students’ obligation to
clarify the question with the instructor before committing or attempting to commit the
act. Additional information about a common form of academic misconduct, plagiarism, is
available at
https://researchguides.uoregon.edu/citing-plagiarism.
Accessible Education: The University of Oregon is working to create inclusive learning
environments. Please notify me if there are aspects of the instruction or design of this
course that result in disability-related barriers to your participation. You are also encour-
aged to contact the Accessible Education Center in 360 Oregon Hall at 541-346-1155 or
uoaec@uoregon.edu.
Accommodation for Religious Observances: The university makes reasonable accom-
modations, upon request, for students who are unable to attend a class for religious obliga-
tions or observance reasons, in accordance with the university discrimination policy which
says “Any student who, because of religious beliefs, is unable to attend classes on a partic-
ular day shall be excused from attendance requirements and from any examination or other
assignment on that day. The student shall make up the examination or other assignment
missed because of the absence.” To request accommodations for this course for religious
observance, visit the Office of the Registrar’s website
https://registrar.uoregon.edu/calendars/religious-observances
andcompleteandsubmittotheinstructorthe“StudentReligiousAccommodationRequest”
form prior to the end of the second week of the term.
Basic Needs: Any student who has difficulty affording groceries or accessing sufficient
food to eat every day, or who lacks a safe and stable place to live and believes this may

affect their performance in the course is urged to contact the Dean of Students Office (346-
3216, 164 Oregon Hall) for support. This UO webpage includes resources for food, housing,
healthcare, childcare, transportation, technology, finances, and legal support:
https://blogs.uoregon.edu/basicneeds/food.
Inclement Weather: It is generally expected that class will meet unless the University
is officially closed for inclement weather. If it becomes necessary to cancel class while the
University remains open, this will be announced on Canvas and by email. Updates on
inclement weather and closure are also communicated in other ways described here:
https://hr.uoregon.edu/about-hr/campus-notifications/inclement-weather.
Mental Health and Wellness: Life at college can be very complicated. Students often
feel overwhelmed or stressed, experience anxiety or depression, struggle with relationships,
or just need help navigating challenges in their life. If you’re facing such challenges, you
don’t need to handle them on your own–there’s help and support on campus.
As your instructor if I believe you may need additional support, I will express my con-
cerns, the reasons for them, and refer you to resources that might be helpful. It is not my
intention to know the details of what might be bothering you, but simply to let you know I
care and that help is available. Getting help is a courageous thing to do—for yourself and
those you care about.
University Health Services help students cope with difficult emotions and life stressors.
If you need general resources on coping with stress or want to talk with another student
who has been in the same place as you, visit the Duck Nest (located in the EMU on the
ground floor) and get help from one of the specially trained Peer Wellness Advocates. Find
out more at health.uoregon.edu/ducknest.
University Counseling Services (UCS) has a team of dedicated staff members to support
you with your concerns, many of whom can provide identity-based support. All clinical
services are free and confidential. Find out more at counseling.uoregon.edu or by calling
541-346-3227 (anytime UCS is closed, the After-Hours Support and Crisis Line is available
by calling this same number).
