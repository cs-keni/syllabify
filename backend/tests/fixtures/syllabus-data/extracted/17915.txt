Description:
Over the past decade, there has been an intense interest in all things made of carbon particularly
applications employing carbon nanotubes and graphene. This course will introduce the science
and technology of carbon nanomaterials and their electronic, optical, and sensor properties. The
course will begin with a basic review of quantum mechanics and elementary theory of solids, and
progress to contemporary topics including carbon synthesis, sensor devices, energy devices,
interconnects, transistors, and circuit applications of carbon nanomaterials. In addition, beyond
carbon two-dimensional materials and devices will be discussed, such as MoS and TMDs.

Learning Outcomes:
By the end of the course, students will be able to derive the electronic structure of graphene and
related materials, understand electronic and quantum transport, and critically evaluate the pros
and cons of publications on the material properties and applications of 2D materials.

Grading
30% Homework, 30% Midterm Project, 30% Final Project, 10% Class Participation
Add/Drop Policy
Graduate ECE students have the first 12 days of the semester to add and drop graduate ECE
courses. Dropping a course after the 12th day of the semester must be approved by the Graduate
ECE advisor and Dean of the Graduate school, among others.
Academic Honesty
Discussion of homework questions is encouraged. However, please submit your own
independent homework solutions. Plagiarism of any form of academic misconduct (including but
not limited to, copying another student’s work, copying material directly from a book, article or
web site without proper acknowledgement, falsifying data, doing someone else’s work) is a
violation of University rules and will result in disciplinary actions.

Students with Disabilities
The University of Texas at Austin provides upon request appropriate academic adjustments for
qualified students with disabilities. For more information, contact the Office of the Dean
Students at 471-6259, 471-4241, TDD, or the College of Engineering Director of Students with
disabilities at 471-4382
Counseling and Mental Health
Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising, avoiding
drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will help you
achieve your goals and cope with stress. Keep screen time and social media usage to a
minimum to avoid its negative effect on mental health.
All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not alone. There are many
helpful resources available on campus and an important part of the college experience is learning
how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is often helpful.
If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like
anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support.

Title IX Reporting
Title IX is a federal law that protects against sex and gender-based discrimination, sexual
harassment, sexual assault, sexual misconduct, dating/domestic violence and stalking at federally
funded educational institutions. UT Austin is committed to fostering a learning and working
environment free from discrimination in all its forms where all students, faculty, and staff can
learn, work, and thrive. When sexual misconduct occurs in our community, the university can:
Intervene to prevent harmful behavior from continuing or escalating.
• Provide support and remedies to students and employees who have experienced harm or have
become involved in a Title IX investigation.
• Investigate and discipline violations of the university's relevant policies.
Faculty members and certain staff members are considered ``Responsible Employees'' or
``Mandatory Reporters,'' which means that they are required to report violations of Title IX to the
Title IX Coordinator at UT Austin. I am a Responsible Employee and must report any Title IX

related incidents that are disclosed in writing, discussion, or one-on-one. Before talking with me,
or with any faculty or staff member about a Title IX related incident, be sure to ask whether they
are a responsible employee. If you want to speak with someone for support or remedies without
making an official report to the university, email advocate@austin.utexas.edu. For more info
about reporting options and resources, visit https://titleix.utexas.edu/campus-resources or contact
the Title IX Office at titleix@austin.utexas.edu.
