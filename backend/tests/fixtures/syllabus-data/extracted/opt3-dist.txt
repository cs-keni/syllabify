Regrade Requests
Request for regrading an assignment or Test must be made in writing within one week of the graded assignment
or test being made available to students in the class.
Q Drop Policy
If you would like to drop a class after the 12th class day, you'll need to execute a Q drop before the Q-drop
deadline, which typically occurs near the middle of the semester. Under Texas law, you are only allowed six Q
drops while you are in college at any public Texas institution. For more information,
see http://www.utexas.edu/ugs/csacc/academic/adddrop/qdrop.
Religious Holy Days
A student who misses classes or other required activities, including examinations, for the observance of a
religious holy day should inform the instructor as far in advance of the absence as possible so that arrangements
can be made to complete an assignment within a reasonable period after the absence. A reasonable
accommodation does not include substantial modification to academic standards, or adjustments of requirements
essential to any program of instruction. Students and instructors who have questions or concerns about academic
accommodations for religious observance or religious beliefs may contact the Office for Inclusion and Equity.
The University does not maintain a list of religious holy days.
Disabilities statement: "The University of Texas at Austin provides upon request, appropriate academic
accommodations for qualified students with disabilities. For more information, contact the Division of Diversity
and Community Engagement, Services for Students with Disabilities, at (512) 471-6259, 471-4641

COVID-19 Pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic has been disrupting our health and well-being for several months. More than 1.5% of
the US population has tested positive, including friends and family in some cases. Its cumulative effect has taken
a serious toll on our physical and mental health. Many of our friends and family have lost their jobs or been
furloughed. Many of us are living in an environment that may not have a quiet place to study or adequate
Internet access. Please let me know if you face difficulties this semester in accessing course resources or
completing work. The University provides student emergency assistance through Texas One Stop (US
citizens), Texas Global (International), Student Emergency Fund (All Students).
COVID-19 Guidance
To help keep everyone at UT and in our community safe, it is critical that all students report COVID-19
symptoms and testing, regardless of test results, to University Health Services, and faculty and staff report to
the HealthPoint Occupational Health Program (OHP) as soon as possible. Please see this link to understand what
needs to be reported. In addition, to help understand what to do if a fellow student in the class (or the instructor
or TA) tests positive for COVID, see University Health Services.
Title IX Reporting
Title IX is a federal law that protects against sex and gender-based discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual
assault, sexual misconduct, dating/domestic violence and stalking at federally funded educational institutions.
UT Austin is committed to fostering a learning and working environment free from discrimination in all its forms
where all students, faculty, and staff can learn, work, and thrive. When sexual misconduct occurs in our
community, the university can:
1. Intervene to prevent harmful behavior from continuing or escalating.

2. Provide support and remedies to students and employees who have experienced harm or have become
involved in a Title IX investigation.
3. Investigate and discipline violations of the university's relevant policies.
Faculty members and certain staff members are considered ``Responsible Employees'' or ``Mandatory
Reporters,'' which means that they are required to report violations of Title IX to the Title IX Coordinator at UT
Austin. I am a Responsible Employee and must report any Title IX related incidents that are disclosed in
writing, discussion, or one-on-one. Before talking with me, or with any faculty or staff member about a Title IX
related incident, be sure to ask whether they are a responsible employee. If you want to speak with someone for
support or remedies without making an official report to the university, email advocate@austin.utexas.edu. For
more info about reporting options and resources, visit https://titleix.utexas.edu/campus-resources or contact the
Title IX Office at titleix@austin.utexas.edu.
Personal Pronoun Use
Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals and topics dealing with
differences of race, culture, religion, politics, sexual orientation, gender, gender expression, gender variance, and
nationalities. Class rosters are provided to the instructor with the student's legal name, unless they have added a
``preferred name'' with the Gender and Sexuality Center. Canvas provides an opportunity to select a pronoun
preference. I will gladly honor your request to address you by a name that is different from what is on the roster,
and by the gender pronouns you use (she/he/they/ze, etc).
Mental Health Counseling
College can be stressful and sometimes we need a little help. Luckily, we have a wealth of resources and
dedicated people ready to assist you, and treatment does work. The Counseling and Mental Health Center
(CMHC) provides counseling, psychiatric, consultation, and prevention services that facilitate student academic
and life goals and enhance their personal growth and well-being. CMHC counselors are available Monday-
Friday 8am-5pm by phone (512-471-3515) and Zoom videoconference. They are no longer available for in-
person meetings due to social spacing and other precautions to reduce exposure to the coronavirus.
Alternatively, you can talk to Ms. Jeni Wade, LCSW right here in the College of Engineering. Ms. Wade is
our Care Counselor and she can be reached at 512-471-8396.
If you are experiencing a mental health crisis (e.g. depression or anxiety), please call the Mental Health Center
Crisis line at 512-471-CALL(2255). Call even if you aren't sure you're in a full-blown crisis, but sincerely need
help. Staff are there to help you.
Land Acknowledgment
I would like to acknowledge that we are meeting on Indigenous land. Moreover, I would like to acknowledge
and pay our respects to the Carrizo & Comecrudo, Coahuiltecan, Caddo, Tonkawa, Comanche, Lipan Apache,
Alabama-Coushatta, Kickapoo, Tigua Pueblo, and all the American Indian and Indigenous Peoples and
communities who have been or have become a part of these lands and territories in Texas, here on Turtle Island.
