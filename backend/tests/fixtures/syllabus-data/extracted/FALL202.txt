Course Description: This course examines how to provide a direct interaction between the
human neural system and machines aiming to augment human capabilities, especially of
disabled people. It provides an introduction to the human brain functional organization. It
describes different brain signals that can be recorded for a brain-computer interface along
with the interaction paradigms where they can be decoded and exploited. Emphasis is on
electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, which is the most common source for brain-computer
interfaces and the kind of signals used for the homework and projects. It also covers the
design principles of complex brain-controlled devices beyond recording brain signals,
enhancing their signal-to-noise ratio, and decoding subjects' intents and cognitive states.
Text: (1) Lecture Notes, taken from a variety of sources, available on the Canvas website.

Grading Scheme: Homework 25% + Paper Presentation: 15% + Term Project 60%.
Each item will be graded in the scale 1-10.
Attendance at all classes is expected, but not part of the grade.
Late submissions will not be accepted except by consent of instructor.
Homework: 3 individual exercises across the course based on data from BCI experiments.
Discussion of homework questions amongst students is encouraged. However,
copying another’s work is cheating. Academic integrity is paramount and cheating
will not be tolerated (see below).
Term Project: teams of 3 students will perform their own BCI experiments involving all
team members over a few experimental sessions. Some lecture slots (2-4) during the
course will be devoted to discussing progress and problems on the projects.
Timing: presentation, 15 min; Q&A, 10 min.
Grading: written report (35%); oral presentation to the whole class (25%).

Report must contain a statement of work done by each team member, indicating each
member’s contribution (i.e., topics and percentage of total effort).
Paper Presentation: same teams of 3 students will present a paper to the whole class (from
a set of 2-3 topics) and critique another team’s presentation on another paper of the
same topic.
Timing: presentation, 15 min; critique, 5 min; discussion, 5 min.
Grading: presentation, 10%; critique, 5 %.
Letter Grades: In this course, plus and minus letter grades will be assigned.

Grade Disputes or Corrections: If you discover an error in a grade assigned to you, you must
submit your complaint, along with supporting evidence or arguments, to me (or to your TA
or grader) within one week of the date that I (or your TA or grader) first attempted to return

the assignment results to you. Complaints about grades received after the one-week
deadline will be considered only if there are extraordinary circumstances for missing the
deadline. Assignments submitted for re-grading will be completely re-graded.
Academic Integrity: Plagiarism or any form of academic dishonesty (cheating includes, but is
not limited to, copying another student's work, stealing another student’s homework,
bringing notes into a test and copying material directly from a book, article or web site
without including appropriate references, falsifying data, doing someone’s work) is a
violation of University rules and may return a grade of zero for each assignment in which it
is detected or may incur even steeper penalties. For more information and University
policies please see: http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/conduct/academicintegrity.php
Sharing of Course Materials is Prohibited: No materials used in this class, including, but not
limited to, lecture hand-outs, videos, assessments (quizzes, exams, papers, projects,
homework assignments), in-class materials, review sheets, and additional problem sets,
may be shared online or with anyone outside of the class unless you have my explicit,
written permission. Unauthorized sharing of materials promotes cheating. It is a violation
of the University’s Student Honor Code and an act of academic dishonesty. I am well
aware of the sites used for sharing materials, and any materials found online that are
associated with you, or any suspected unauthorized sharing of materials, will be reported to
Student Conduct and Academic Integrity in the Office of the Dean of Students. These
reports can result in sanctions, including failure in the course.
Class Recordings: Class recordings are reserved only for students in this class for educational
purposes and are protected under FERPA. The recordings should not be shared outside the
class in any form. Violation of this restriction by a student could lead to Student
Misconduct proceedings.
Learning and Growth: Throughout the course, your learning and growth in theory and practice
of the engineering profession are important to me. We all need accommodations because
we all learn differently, and the current pandemic makes accommodations all the more
important. If there are aspects of this course that prevent you from learning or exclude you,
please let me know as soon as possible. Together we will develop strategies to meet your
needs and course requirements. I also encourage you to reach out to the resources available
through UT. Many are on this syllabus. I am happy to connect you with a person or Center
if you would like.
Artificial Intelligence: The creation of artificial intelligence tools for widespread use is an
exciting innovation. These tools have both appropriate and inappropriate uses in classwork.
The use of artificial intelligence tools (such as ChatGPT) in this class is permitted for
students who wish to use them, provided the content generated by AI is properly cited. AI
writing tools should be used with caution and proper citation, as the use of AI should be
properly attributed. Failing to properly cite AI even where permitted, shall constitute a
violation of UT Austin’s Institutional Rules on academic integrity. If you are considering
the use of AI writing tools but are unsure if you are allowed or the extent to which they
may be utilized appropriately, please ask.

Title IX Reporting: Title IX is a federal law that protects against sex and gender-based
discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual assault, sexual misconduct, dating/domestic
violence and stalking at federally funded educational institutions. UT Austin is committed
to fostering a learning and working environment free from discrimination in all its forms
where all students, faculty, and staff can learn, work, and thrive. When sexual misconduct
occurs in our community, the university can:
1. Intervene to prevent harmful behavior from continuing or escalating.
2. Provide support and remedies to students and employees who have experienced harm
or have become involved in a Title IX investigation.
3. Investigate and discipline violations of the university's relevant policies.

Faculty members and certain staff members are considered ``Responsible Employees'' or
``Mandatory Reporters,'' which means that they are required to report violations of Title IX
to the Title IX Coordinator at UT Austin. Before talking with me, or with any faculty or
staff member about a Title IX related incident, be sure to ask whether they are a
responsible employee. If you want to speak with someone for support or remedies without
making an official report to the university, email advocate@austin.utexas.edu. For more
