I. Introduction
Integrative Finance enables you to apply what you have learned in previous finance courses to the
solution of realistic business problems. You will employ the concepts and tools of finance to examine a
wide range of business issues and explore potential solutions from the perspective of the chief financial
officer of the firm. The goal of the course is to familiarize you with the process of analyzing problems,
weighing alternative actions, and choosing the best possible solution(s) to enhance firm value. The
course is designed to model the workplace and prepare you for a job as a financial professional. Much of
the educational process takes place outside of the classroom and you are largely responsible for your own
learning.
II. Goals
The primary goal of the course is to enhance your analytical and problem-solving abilities. Through a
combination of case analyses, readings, lectures, class discussions, and group presentations, students
should: (a) improve their speaking and business writing skills, (b) gain exposure to issues frequently
encountered by business decision makers, (c) develop personal and professional skills valued by
employers (e.g., time management, planning, collaboration, responsibility, and integrity), and d) discover
that success in the workplace requires a combination of quantitative and qualitative skills.
III. Classroom Expectations
Active attendance, participation, and preparation are required, as most of our classroom activities are
devoted to case discussions. Students are expected to attend every class, prepare every assignment, and
participate in every class discussion. Specific information and study questions will be furnished for each
assignment. If you are unfamiliar with the presentation topic, please review the textbooks from your
previous finance courses and supplemental course materials.
IV. Course Materials (Required)
1. Course Packet: The assigned cases and readings are available at the University CO-OP
• Title: FIN 370, W. Way & K. Wiles, Spring 2019 [ISBN: 9780840098436]
• Subtitle: Integrative Finance, Volumes 1 and II (burnt orange cover)
• The Midterm and Final cases will be available at a later date
2. Other material and readings posted on Canvas or available online

V. Grade Computation
10 Case Summaries (out of 17; excludes your group presentation) [Independent] 10%
1 Midterm Case (Staff Analysis & Case Exhibits) [Independent] 30%
1 Group Case Presentation and supporting documents 10%
1 Final Case (Staff Analysis & Case Exhibits) [Independent] 30%
Class Attendance/Participation/Preparation (A/P/P) 15%
Peer Evaluation 5%
Final letter grades will be assigned according to the following criteria:
A >93 A- 90-92.9 B+ 87-89.9 B 83-86.9 B- 80-82.9 C+ 77-79.9 C 73-76.9 C- 70-72.9, etc.
You will receive a numeric score for each assignment. Final grades will not be determined until the
scores for all assignments are averaged, as indicated above. Final course grades may reflect the
application of a small curve. The target GPA for the course is approximately 3.40. All course grades
are final, except in the instance of a recording error.
Assignments that are submitted on a timely basis will be returned approximately two weeks after their
submission. If you have a question about any grade assigned, you must submit the question in writing,
within one week after the assignment is returned. Your inquiry should include your name, UT EID,
section number, the title of the assignment, and a written explanation of why you think the grade is
incorrect. I retain the right to raise or lower grades after review.
VI. Written Work (70% of course grade)
This course carries the Writing Flag. Writing Flag courses are designed to give students experience
with writing in an academic discipline. In this class, you can expect to write regularly during the
semester, complete substantial writing projects, and receive feedback from your instructor to help you
improve your writing. You will also have the opportunity to revise one assignment and to read and
discuss your peers' work.
This course also carries the Independent Inquiry Flag. The purpose of the Independent Inquiry flag is
to engage students in the process of inquiry over the course of a semester, providing them with the
opportunity for independent investigation of a question, problem, or project related to their major. To
that end, courses carrying this flag require students to complete projects and assignments involving
independent investigation and presentation of their own work.
Each student will submit multiple written assignments based on cases from the course packet. The two
major independent case assignments (Midterm and Final) include a Staff Analysis (SA) and a set of
prepared Case Exhibits (CE). Other case assignments include independently prepared Case Summaries
for each case discussed in class.
A. Submission of Written Work – All formal case assignments (Midterm and Final) are due as
indicated in the course schedule. Papers submitted after the due date/time will be penalized 5 points (out
of 100) for each 24-hour period (or fraction thereof) beyond the deadline. The late penalty will be
allocated between the hard copy and electronic copy of your paper (3 points and 2 points,
respectively).
2

Formal cases (Midterm and Final) must be submitted in two ways:
1. A hard copy of your paper is due in the Finance Department office (CBA 6.222)
• A “baby blue” grade sheet, bearing an electronic time/date stamp to document timely
submittal, is required when submitting papers. No other cover sheet is required.
• Papers without a time/date stamp will automatically be deemed late.
• Papers will not be accepted after the assignment is reviewed in any FIN 370 class!
2. An electronic copy of your paper must be uploaded to Canvas
• All electronically submitted assignments will be reviewed by Turnitin.
• Due dates/times and late penalties also apply to the electronic copy of your paper!
B. Case Summaries – Students will prepare a Case Summary (one page, single-spaced) to evidence their
case preparation. Case Summaries are designed to motivate class discussion; hence, you must attend
class to fulfill this requirement. Absences due to illness/interview are no exception, so please plan
accordingly. Students are responsible for completing 10 of the 17 Case Summary assignments. You
cannot submit a Case Summary for the case that your group presents (see below). Case summaries are
due at the end of class and must be word-processed to evidence their preparation before class.
C. Peer Review/Revision – Students will have the opportunity to revise and rewrite the Case Summary
assignments if they are unhappy with their grade.
❖ As this course has a writing flag, many assignments require that the work be entirely your
own (i.e., Midterm Case, Final Case, and Case Summaries).
❖ Students may not work together on these assignments and the specific language, structure,
and format of each student’s paper must be independent.
❖ Do not share your analyses, use the papers of any other FIN 370 student (current or
former), or use unauthorized sources in preparing a written assignment!
VII. Group Presentations (10% of course grade)
The class will be organized into 6 case groups of approximately 5 to 6 students each, depending on class
size. Groups are formed at students’ discretion, on a first come, first served basis; however, I reserve the
right to reassign students to ensure balanced group sizes.
A. Case Presentations – Each case group will be responsible for presenting one case during the
semester. The goal of the presentation is to “teach” the case to your classmates and engage them in a
discussion of the relevant qualitative and quantitative issues. Case presentations should last
approximately 60 minutes and will be followed by a critique/feedback session. All presentation grades
are individual; hence, everyone in the group should participate equally in the presentation.
• Case presentations should be supported by PowerPoint slides, Excel spreadsheets, and/or
handouts. Copies of this material must be presented to the instructor before the presentation
begins. Late submission of presentation materials will be penalized.
• Group members are strongly urged to visit with the professor during office hours to check
numbers, discuss case methodology, and ensure that the “teaching” goal is accomplished.
Incorrect numbers and faulty methodology will be penalized.

VIII. Class Attendance/Participation/Preparation (A/P/P) (15% of course grade)
The success of this course depends on the active participation of the audience. To this end, a significant
portion of the course grade is devoted to qualities such as preparation, timeliness, attentiveness,
responsiveness, and professionalism.
Your A/P/P grade is determined by your faithful and punctual attendance, preparation for class
assignments, the quantity/quality of your contributions to class discussions, and your professional
comportment during class. Each student is expected to attend the class section for which they are
registered, participate in every class discussion, and display their name card at all times.
• You are allowed the equivalent of two absences for any reason.
o In combination, instances of tardiness, leaving early, and/or non-participation are
the equivalent of an absence (see grade calculation, below).
o If you have more than two unexcused absences (or the equivalent), each additional
infraction will reduce your A/P/P grade.
• Two additional absences for interviewing may be completely excused. Interview absences
exceeding this number will be excused for attendance, but not for participation.
o You must provide interview documentation within two weeks of your absence.
o Examples of this documentation include an interview schedule, plane ticket, etc.
• Absences due to illness or emergencies may be excused with timely and appropriate
documentation, as determined by the instructor. Documentation must be provided within two
weeks of your absence.
• An excused absence does not excuse any assignment that is due on that day.
A/P/P Grade Calculation
• Attendance, including instances of tardiness and leaving early, is recorded for each class session
beginning the second week of class.
• Participation credit is awarded to:
o Members of the group who make a case presentation
o Audience members who make a constructive contribution to the class discussion
• Each student begins with a total of 108 points. The eight additional points offset
unexcused/undocumented absences or instances of tardiness/leaving early, non-participation, etc.,
in any combination. Points are deducted for each infraction as follows:
o Unexcused absence = -4 points
o Tardiness/leaving early = -1 point
o Attended class, but did not participate = -2 points
o Excess excused absences for interviewing (> 2) = -2 points
o Excess unexcused absences (> 4) = -8 points
o Excess tardiness/leaving early (> 4) = -2 points
• Your final Attendance/Participation/Preparation grade equals the total score derived using these
values (Maximum A/P/P Score = 100).
• Use your A/P/P points wisely . . . There is no opportunity to restore lost points.
4

IX. Peer Evaluation (5% of course grade)
At the end of the semester, I will ask each member of the class to evaluate the contribution of other class
members to the quality of the class discussion throughout the semester. This portion of the grade is based
on your classmates’ perception of the quality and quantity of your class participation and preparation.
Quality is the far more important of the two dimensions, and while each comment will be judged on its
merits, worrying about each comment is counterproductive. Your contribution to moving the class
forward during the semester is the most important element of this grade.
X. Other Grading Criteria
The primary basis for grading written assignments is content; however, professionalism in presentation is
also given substantial weight. The writing skills component of the analysis considers formatting,
spelling, grammar, punctuation, appropriateness, clarity, and thought. The following book is
recommended for aiding in the preparation of written work: Strunk, William, Jr. and E.B. White, “The
Elements of Style.”
Anyone who needs additional assistance in mastering basic writing skills can receive help through the
Undergraduate Writing Center in the Flawn Academic Center, Room 211, or by calling 471-6222. The
website for the Writing Center is http://www.uwc.fac.utexas.edu/
Specific instructions for preparing Staff Analysis writing assignments (Midterm and Final Cases)
are available in the course document entitled, “Guidelines for Writing Case Analyses,” which is
available on Canvas.
XI. Academic Integrity
Policy on Scholastic Dishonesty: The McCombs School of Business has no tolerance for acts of
scholastic dishonesty. The responsibilities of both students and faculty with regard to scholastic
dishonesty are described in detail in the BBA Program’s Statement on Scholastic Dishonesty at
http://www.mccombs.utexas.edu/BBA/Code-of-Ethics.aspx. By teaching this course, I have agreed to
observe all faculty responsibilities described in that document. By enrolling in this class, you have
agreed to observe all student responsibilities described in that document. If the application of the
Statement on Scholastic Dishonesty to this class or its assignments is unclear in any way, it is your
responsibility to ask me for clarification. Students who violate University rules on scholastic dishonesty
are subject to disciplinary penalties, including the possibility of failure in the course and/or dismissal
from the University. Since dishonesty harms the individual, all students, the integrity of the University,
and the value of our academic brand, policies on scholastic dishonesty will be strictly enforced. You
should refer to the Student Judicial Services website at http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/ to access the
official University policies and procedures on scholastic dishonesty as well as further elaboration on
what constitutes scholastic dishonesty.
❖ Unless specifically indicated otherwise, all writing assignments must be individually
prepared by the student to avoid scholastic dishonesty. If you have any questions regarding
this policy, please ask the instructor.
❖ Instances of scholastic dishonesty will be referred to the Dean of Students and may result in
significant grade penalties.

C. Computers and Electronic Devices – In accordance with Department of Finance policy, the use of
laptop and tablet computers is prohibited, except for making class presentations. All electronic devices
(cell phones, MP3s, etc.) should be stowed away during the class session. Violation of these policies,
including texting and web surfing during class, will reduce your A/P/P grade.
D. Religious Holy Days – By UT Austin policy, you must notify me of your pending absence at least
fourteen days prior to the date of observance of a religious holy day. If you must miss a class, an
examination, a work assignment, or a project to observe a religious holy day, you will be given an
opportunity to complete the missed work within a reasonable time after the absence.
E. Campus Safety – Please note the following recommendations regarding emergency evacuation,
provided by the Office of Campus Safety and Security, 512-471-5767, http://www.utexas.edu/safety:
• Occupants of buildings on The University of Texas at Austin campus are required to evacuate
buildings when a fire alarm is activated. Alarm activation or announcement requires exiting
and assembling outside.
• Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of each classroom and building you may occupy.
Remember that the nearest exit door may not be the one you used when entering the building.
• Students requiring assistance in evacuation should inform the instructor in writing during the
first week of class.
• In the event of an evacuation, follow the instruction of faculty or class instructors.
• Do not re-enter a building unless given instructions by the following: Austin Fire Department,

XIII. Additional Comments
The requirements and recommendations for succeeding in this course are outlined in this syllabus. Since
no extra-credit is available, I encourage you to follow these policies and utilize office hours to maximize
your understanding of the assignments and their specific requirements. These policies provide the basic
guidelines and code of conduct for this course. They are designed to reduce confusion and establish an
equitable framework for the entire class. As a matter of principle, I will enforce these policies fairly and
religiously.
The “spirit” of the course is just as important as the “rules and regulations.” My goal is to create a
cooperative classroom environment in which we learn from each other. To that end, I welcome your
constructive comments and suggestions as we progress through the course. Your feedback is an
important element of course delivery and development.
Barring an emergency, I will be available during office hours and at additional times. I encourage
you to visit with me regarding the class assignments, concerns with the course, or just to say
“hello.” I am also accessible via telephone or E-mail. I will make every effort to return your call or
respond to your E-mail within one business day of its receipt.
