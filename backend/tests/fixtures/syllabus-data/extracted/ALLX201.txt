DESCRIPTION: Error-correcting codes provide a way to efficiently add
redundancy to data, so that the original data can be recovered even in the
presence of noise. Such codes are essential in modern communication and
storage of data, where high reliability is required. From its engineering roots,
coding theory has evolved to use sophisticated mathematical techniques,
centering around algebra but also involving probability and combinatorics.
Moreover, coding theory has recently found unexpected uses in computer
science.
In this interdisciplinary course, we study coding theory from the different
perspectives of professors in math, computer science, and electrical engineering.
We develop the mathematical tools, construct important codes and associated
algorithms, and discuss applications in computer science and communication.
Class Outline

Part II: Algorithmic coding: including decoding algorithms, concatenated codes and
applications to complexity theory
Part III: Random Coding and Communications: Shannon’s coding theorem, LDPC and
rateless coding, network coding and related topics.
