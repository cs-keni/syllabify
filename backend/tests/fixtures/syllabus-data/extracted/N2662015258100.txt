Teaching Methods:
Lectures, on line guest lecturers, case studies, group activities, discussions, and exams. Lecture
outlines for this course will be available on CANVAS in the "Course Documents" file. Students
are encouraged to download and print the class discussion outline prior to attending class.
Methods of Evaluation and Grading Policies:
The course grade will be computed from points earned on 2 exams and assignments noted in the
following table. The student must achieve a grade of 74.5% or better in order to pass the course.
A course grade of “C” will be assigned to course scores of 74.5 to 79.4%. 79.5-89.4% is a course
grade of “B”, and 89.5% or greater is a course grade of “A”.
Course Grade Breakdown:
Evaluation Activity % of Final Grade
Exam 1 40%
Exam 2 (Not comprehensive) 40%
Response Paper to Video Making Every Moment Count 10%
Class Attendance / Pre-class Quizzes/ (10 quizzes each worth 1%) 10%
Details:
• Pre-Class Quizzes will be used to encourage both attendance and preparation for class.
o Quizzes will begin promptly at the start of class (10:00 AM). The quizzes will last for 5
minutes.
o Quizzes cannot be made up.
§ In the event of illness or family emergency, you must contact the instructor prior to
the class. If the absence is excused, you may receive credit for the quiz by answering
the NCLEX questions at the end of the chapter corresponding in the textbook for that
day. Excused means an "official" doctor's note. These must be turned in no later than
one week after the missed class day in order to receive credit.
o Quizzes will consist of 3 NCLEX-style questions based on the assigned reading material
for the day. Answers will be discussed at 10:05 AM. Everyone who completes the quiz
will receive the point for that day (i.e., you will not lose credit for questions answered
incorrectly).
2

N266 Spring 2015
o Quizzes for online lectures are available online and completed by 11:59 pm on the
scheduled lecture date.
• Exams:
o Exams will consist of NCLEX-style multiple-choice questions. There will be 9-15
questions per lecture.
o Over the years, many students have told me that the best way to prepare for the NCLEX
is to complete practice questions. The reviews and rationales book that is required is an
excellent way for you to prepare for NCLEX. In order to encourage you to review these
practice questions, I will select 1 NCLEX review question from every chapter that is
covered on the exam and place the question on the exam verbatim. So, if you have
reviewed the practice questions before the exam, then you will see some of those exact
questions on the exam.
Group Assignment: Please sign up on CANVAS by Wednesday, February 4 for Section B
and Thursday, April 2 for Section A. Choose an infectious disease and be prepared to present
the mode of transmission, causative agent, major defining signs/symptoms and immunization
schedule in class on Wednesday, February 18 for section B and Thursday, April 16 for
Section A. Please post your research on the Google document on CANVAS.
Response Paper to Video: Making Every Moment Count
After watching the video Making Every Moment Count, you will write a one-half to one page
response paper. This writing activity is a type of “debriefing” exercise. Most students are
somewhat affected by what they see in the video. Many thoughts and emotions are often evoked
after seeing what these patients and families go through. We understand that everyone will react
differently based upon your life experiences. We look at this assignment as a way for you to
identify and articulate your thoughts and feelings, instead of keeping them inside. As a nurse, it
is important to talk about things you see in your practice, or sometimes write them down, in
order to process everything and continue to practice successfully and effectively. This
assignment counts as 10% of your total course grade. No numeric weighting will be given to
your paper. You will earn either a 100 or a zero. This assignment will be due the day after
viewing the video (see the course calendar). Submit paper online via CANVAS not via email.
Papers submitted late or directions are not followed may be assessed a 10-point penalty
deduction per day at the discretion of the instructor. Due Friday, February 13 for Section B
and Friday, April 17 for Section A.

Student Responsibilities:
Honor Codes: The profession of nursing has a legacy of public respect and trust. We provide
specialized care for the health needs of individuals and the community with integrity, honesty,
compassion, and state of the art knowledge and skills. Learning and practicing responsible and
ethical professional behavior is a vital part of professional education. The Institutional Rules on
Student Services and Activities given in the General Information Catalog (Chapter 11) and The
University of Texas at Austin’s Honor Code apply to all nursing students:
The core values of The University of Texas at Austin are learning, discovery, freedom, leadership,
individual opportunity, and responsibility. Each member of the University is expected to uphold
these values through integrity, honesty, trust, fairness, and respect toward peers and community.
Additionally, the School of Nursing has its own honor code:
As a student in The University of Texas at Austin’s School of Nursing, I pledge myself to be
honest in all of my student activities including, but not limited to, all of my scholastic work and
interactions with patients, members of the community, faculty, and peers. Furthermore, I will not
use any substance prior to or during my interaction with patients that could alter my judgment or
ability to render safe care: this includes but is not limited to any use of alcohol, illegal drugs, and
prescription or over-the counter drugs that may impair my mental and/or physical abilities
required to perform safe patient care. I will disclose to my instructor any violations of the above
standards of conduct.
Attendance Policy: The student is expected to attend all classes and exam sessions. Exams will
start at the beginning of class on the dates scheduled. In the event of exceptional circumstances,
which make it impossible for a student to be present for a scheduled test, arrangements must be
made with the facilitator in advance. If prior arrangements are not made with the facilitator the
student may not be permitted to take the test. If for unusual reasons, the student is permitted to
take the test, a 10-point raw score penalty may be incurred at the discretion of the instructors.
Additional information on attendance policies is contained in The University of Texas at Austin
General Information Bulletin.
Course Repeat Policy: A student may repeat a nursing course only once. If the student does not
earn a grade of at least "C" upon repeating the course, s/he cannot continue in the School of
Nursing. If while repeating the course, the student drops or withdraws from The University at a
time when the student's performance in the course is considered to be inferior to that required for
a grade of "C", s/he may not enroll in the course or continue in the School of Nursing.
Use of Laptops and other Electronic Devices: Computer (not cell phones, iPods, or MP3 players)
use is permitted during class if it is used for note taking or to access the required readings.
Students who misuse technology (e.g., accessing email, social networking) during class will be
asked to leave the classroom and may receive a deduction of up to 10% from their final course
grade. During all testing periods, all phones and electronic devices will remain in the off
position and in your backpack placed at the front or along the side of the room. Should you
need to leave your phone on due to an emergency circumstance, please inform the instructor
prior to class.

N266 Spring 2015
Scholastic Dishonesty: Refer to the General Information for information on the Scholastic
Dishonesty Policy Sec. 11-802. Scholastic dishonesty includes, but is not limited to cheating,
plagiarism, collusion, falsifying academic records, and misrepresenting facts. The Dean of
Students Office records acts of dishonesty and notifies the School of Nursing of each incident. In
addition to all of the University statements and policies relative to academic dishonesty, the
School of Nursing recognizes the strong link between honesty in academic work and
professional integrity. Any act of academic dishonesty, including fabrication of reports or
records of interactions with clients, is considered incompatible with ethical standards of nursing
practice. The School of Nursing does not admit students who have a record of violations to the
professional sequence. Students who engage in scholastic dishonesty may be subject to dismissal
and may jeopardize their eligibility for licensure as a registered nurse.
Student Conduct Policy: Students and faculty in The School of Nursing each have responsibility
for maintaining an appropriate learning environment. Faculty has the professional responsibility
to treat students with understanding, dignity and respect and to guide the teaching/learning
process. Students are expected to refrain from verbal and nonverbal behaviors in the classroom
and clinical that may be distracting to others, such as, but not limited to: arriving late or leaving
early, side conversations, text messaging, note passing, surfing the internet or answering e-mail
on laptops, and answering cell phone or pager. Students who persistently engage in behaviors
that are disruptive to the teaching/learning process may be required to leave the setting. For
further information refer to General Information, Institutional Rules on Student Services and
Activities, Chapter 11: Student Discipline and Conduct.
The School of Nursing is a professional school and we often have members of the public visiting
our facility; therefore, we require students to dress in a professional manner at all times. There is
a very specific School of Nursing uniform policy for clinical settings. Within the School of
Nursing building we can be a bit more relaxed; however, general rules of dress still apply.
Body piercing, other than ears, must not be visible. Revealing clothing (i.e., midriff baring shirts,
short-shorts or short skirts, or low-rise pants &/or low cut shirts that reveal “cleavage”) must not
be worn or, at a minimum, must be covered while in the School of Nursing.
Please remember that you are representing the School of Nursing and the nursing profession. As
such you are expected to maintain an appropriate level of professionalism.
Academic and Program Accommodations for Students with Disabilities: Refer to the General
Information for information on Academic and Program Accommodations for Students with
Disabilities or contact the Services for Students with Disabilities office in the Office of the Dean
of Students at 471-6259. The School of Nursing works to ensure that students who have
disabilities have equal access to the University’s programs and services.
If you have any questions about services or accommodations for students with disabilities, please
talk with the faculty member, the Assistant Dean for Undergraduate Programs, or the Assistant
Dean for Student and Clinical Affairs or directly call the Office of the Dean of Students, Services
for Students with Disabilities, 471-6259.

TIPS FOR DOING WELL IN CLASS
1. Be present in class: This means being on time, awake, and ready to actively participate.
2. Be familiar with the material before class: I expect you to read the entire chapter before
class, and expect you to have a basic understanding of what I will be talking about.
Review the summary of key points at the end of the chapter, as well as any tables,
pictures, and charts. Review the lecture outline before class and use it as a guide for what
to focus on. Topics that are not covered in the lecture outline will not be specifically
tested.
3. Study efficiently: The test questions are drawn mainly from the lecture. This should
motivate you to come to the lecture!
4. Come to office hours: If you don’t come to office hours, then I assume that you
understand everything and don’t have any questions. If you have any questions, please
stop by!
5. Be present in class: Just in case you didn’t read #1, it is repeated here!
My goals as a teacher are to:
• Promote a classroom environment that makes you want to be in class each day.
• Make learning fun!
• Encourage understanding rather than memorization.
• Tie together many of the facts and concepts you already know into more useable information.
• Provide you with the basic information you need to know to take care of children, because
you will all be pediatric nurses in some shape or form.
• Be straightforward and communicate clearly what your expectations are.
• Be open to feedback from students about the course.

RED FLAGS: DEVELOPMENTAL LAGS
ONE CANNOT AFFORD TO MISS
WATCHING FOR DEVELOPMENTAL LAGS AND DISABILITIES
Most lists that indicate the normal stages of development do not really give a clue about when
one should begin to be seriously concerned about developmental lags and disabilities.
The following table includes many of the “red flags” often indicative of abnormal patterns of
development. In many cases, the presence or absence of any one sign may mean nothing if the
rest of development is normal. Certain signs, in and of themselves, are very important, however.
For example, an infant who has no social smile at 6 months of age demands further investigation.
Indications for Further Evaluation for Developmental Delay
AT 3 MONTHS Does not react to sudden noises
Does not appear to listen to a speaker’s voice
Does not try to find the speaker’s face with his eyes
Has not begun to vocalize sounds
Has been left to lie in a crib for hours without visual or auditory stimulation
Does not raise the head when lying on the stomach
AT 6 MONTHS Does not turn to the speaking person
Does not respond to being played with
Is not visually alert
Never laughs or smiles
Is not babbling
Does not reach for or try to pick up a toy
Is not learning to sit up
Does not appear to be gaining weight
Does not arch the back when lying on the stomach and raising the head
AT 1 YEAR Has not been responding to “Pat-a-Cake,” “Peek-a-Boo,” or other baby games
Is not imitating a variety of speech sounds
Is not saying two or three words such as bye-bye, mama, dada

AT 18 MONTHS Is not yet beginning to feed itself with a spoon
Does not imitate speech or vocalize in jargon
Is not moving about to explore

Nursing Building Evacuation Plan
If you see smoke, see flames, smell something burning, or become aware of another emergency
that may require evacuation of the building, immediately:
1. If possible, ISOLATE the fire or other emergency by closing the door.
2. ACTIVATE the nearest FIRE ALARM PULL STATION.
3. EVACUATE to the PRIMARY or SECONDARY ASSEMBLY AREA.
4. Dial University Police at 911 or Dispatch 471-4441.
DO NOT CALL 911 UNTIL YOU ARE OUTSIDE THE BUILDING.
IF A FIRE ALARM IS ACTIVATED OR IF YOU HAVE RECEIVED AN EVACUATION
ORDER:
• In a calm and orderly manner, proceed to evacuate the area and follow the instructions of the
Floor Managers or emergency response personnel. Each floor has two designated floor
managers. Their role is to ensure that everyone on their floor has proceeded to the fire exit
stairs. Occupants in areas 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 are to exit the first level of the southwest
stairwell. Occupants in areas 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 are to exit the first level of the northwest
stairwell. See maps that follow these instructions.
• Do not rush, push or panic.
• Close your office, classroom, or lab door behind you.
• EVACUATE to the designated ASSEMBLY AREAS. If your progress to one of the
PRIMARY assembly areas is impeded, proceed to the other PRIMARY assembly area
without either re-entering the building or attempting to move through any obstruction.
During inclement weather, proceed to the SECONDARY assembly area.
• DO NOT USE ELEVATORS TO EVACUATE. Descend the nearest fire exit stairs in
single file down to the GROUND LEVEL (first floor) and exit the building. Primary fire
exit stairs are located on the southwest and northwest ends of the building.
• If there is someone who requires assistance, please escort them to the STAGING AREA.
• Do not reenter the building unless directed by UTPD, an Austin Fire Department Officer in
charge, or Building Manager.
• Faculty are responsible for informing their students and any guests of these procedures. If
for some reason your class should meet in a classroom that is not your assigned classroom,
you should provide evacuation instructions for that location.
Refer to the floor-specific plans to determine your evacuation route and assembly area.
DO NOT BLOCK ACCESS TO BUILDING FOR EMERGENCY PERSONNEL. Do not exit
through the front door of the building unless you are in the lobby areas outside the central
elevators/stairwell or unless access to one of the other stairwells is blocked. If you are in the
courtyard outside the second floor lobby, you may exit through the glass doors to the east or
west, then out to one of the designated assembly areas.
ASSEMBLY AREAS
From NORTHWEST FIRE STAIR EXIT—proceed to first floor stairwell exit door to outside of
building. DO NOT ENTER FIRST FLOOR HALLWAY AND EXIT THROUGH GLASS
DOORS. Primary assembly area is toward the north bridge. Secondary assembly area is Trinity

Garage; enter off Lot 23. If there is any construction in the area of the north bridge that prohibits
assembling, proceed to secondary area in Trinity Garage.
From SOUTHWEST FIRE STAIR EXIT— proceed to first floor stairwell exit door to outside of
building. DO NOT ENTER FIRST FLOOR HALLWAY AND EXIT THROUGH GLASS
DOORS. Primary assembly area is toward south bridge. Secondary assembly area is Trinity
Garage; enter off Lot 23. If there is any construction in the area of the south bridge that prohibits
assembling, proceed to secondary area in Trinity Garage.
EVACUATION ASSISTANCE
It is expected that faculty and staff will assist those among us who require assistance in case of
evacuation. If you, or a guest or student, require assistance in emergency situations, please
inform the Building Manager of the type of assistance needed based on the following categories:
• Alarm Notification – occupant has hearing and visual impairments; may be able to easily
navigate stairs but require notification if the alarm has activated. This can be the case if a
person with hearing impairments is working in an office with the door closed.
• Slow Evacuation Capability – occupant can navigate stairs but requires some assistance or
who move at a much slower pace than others.
• Impractical Evacuation Capability – occupants who cannot navigate the exit stairs. To
evacuate the building, this occupant must be carried down or evacuated through an elevator
provided with emergency service.
The names of those provided will be kept in the fire alarm panel for use by emergency
responders.
STAGING AREA
If an occupant needs assistance, please escort them to the area outside the stairwell. If they are
unable to use the stairs, wait until everyone has evacuated the area, move them into the stairwell,
and after evacuating the building, inform your Floor Manager where you have left them.
