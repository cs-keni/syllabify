Acknowledgement: Much of the course material we are using was written by Greg Sitz. I’ll
thank Greg for this here, and use this material without further acknowledgement.
Prerequisites: PHY 315, Wave Motion and Optics. Credit for PHY 355 is recommended but not
required.
Purpose of this course: This class is intended develop your ability to
 perform experiments that are more involved and difficult than the ones you completed in
introductory labs,
 use a variety of laboratory equipment and techniques,
 properly document your work in a lab book,
 carry out accurate error analysis,
 write up and present your results in a coherent, complete manner,
 and to learn more about atomic, molecule, optical, and nuclear physics.
It is also a writing flag course as discussed below.
Resources:
Course web site: Background information on the individual experiments can be found at
http://www.ph.utexas.edu/~phy353l. The username is phy353l and the password is
juniorlab. This site will be your primary resource for selecting and performing experiments.
Canvas: Some tutorials, a LaTex report template, and a guide to report writing will be placed on
the course Canvas site. A detailed document (written by a former 353L student) dealing with
data analysis and report preparation will be posted: filename skillmanual.pdf. A short
introduction to the GnuPlot plotting program will be posted: filename GnuPlot_Primer.pdf.
Grades will be posted on Canvas.
Online: The material from a student-led course, PHY 110C, covering Mathematica, LaTex, and
data analysis, can be found at http://www.evanott.com/data-analysis/.

Books: There is no required textbook for this course. However we highly recommend that you
have one or more books at your disposal that cover the following topics:
1) Elementary modern physics, including statistical physics, quantum physics, and relativity
2) Experimental design and techniques
3) Description of specific modern physics experiments
4) Data analysis
5) Preparing your results for presentation in scientific journals and scientific talks
Suggested books including the following:
Modern physics, by Kenneth Krane, or Modern physics for scientists and engineers, by John
Taylor and Michael Dubson, or Modern physics, 2nd ed.: for scientists and engineers, by John
Morrison. Covers (1)
Experimentation, by David Baird. Covers (2), (4), and (5).
The art of experimental physics, by Daryl Preston and Eric Dietz. Covers (2), (3), (4), and (5).
Experiments in modern physics by Adrian Melissinos and Jim Napolitano. Covers (2) and (3).
Data Reduction and error analysis for the physical sciences, by Philip Bevington and D. Keith
Robinson. Covers (4).
An Introduction to error analysis: the study of uncertainties in physical measurements, by John
Taylor. Covers (4).
PMCL: The PMCL down the hall from the lab has a number of software packages installed that
you can use for data analysis and report preparation. These include Mathematica, MatLab,
KaleidaGraph, a LaTex package, and Microsoft Office.
Homework: You will complete one practice data analysis homework during the first few weeks
of the course. The due date and time for this homework is given in the calendar below.
Lab work: You’ll do your lab work in groups of two, although we will allow one group of one
or one group of three if a section has an odd number of students. You’ll start with a one-day
“experiment bootcamp” which covers basic electrical measurements. The bootcamp lab will be
graded on a credit/no credit basis. After that, you’ll carry out five experiments. You’ll pick
experiments from the list of available experiments given below. You should choose one of the
easier experiments for the first experiment, and you should include more difficult experiments
towards the end of the semester. You should choose experiments on a variety of topics. Note that
only one group in a given section can do a particular lab each week, so look over the available
labs and sign up promptly for the ones that interest you. Experiment choices are subject to
instructor approval.
Some labs are more difficult than others or have flexible experimental goals. Students who elect
to do more difficult labs or to take on more ambitious experimental goals for a particular lab may
receive a higher lab report grade than students who stick to easier labs or experimental goals.
Lab book: You are required to have and keep a lab notebook. This must be bound and not have
loose pages. A quadrille, composition-style lab book is ideal. You should develop the habit of
writing in your lab book. A lot. Diagrams and sketches are viewed with particular favor. The TA
will periodically check your lab book.
2

Written reports: You will complete a written lab report for each experiment. For your lab work,
you will work together with your partner. But you must complete your data analysis and write
your report on your own. You will submit your reports electronically to Canvas. You are
encouraged to prepare your report using LaTex, but you may use MS Word if you wish. Students
wishing to use LaTex may find this web site to be useful: https://www.sharelatex.com/.
You should use a scientific plotting program such as GnuPlot to prepare your graphs. You may
NOT prepare graphs with Excel. Other guidelines for your report are posted and will be
discussed in the course. Reports are due at the dates and times on the schedule below.
Writing flag; revision of lab reports: This is a writing flag course, designed to give students
experience with writing in an academic discipline. In order to meet the requirements of a writing
flag course, we’ll do the following:
 Your grades for all lab reports will be based in part on your writing quality, and you’ll
receive feedback on that writing quality.
 We’ll meet briefly with each student June 14-15 to specifically discuss ways to improve
the writing quality of their first submitted lab report. Students wishing to resubmit their
Lab 1 report based on the feedback may do so, and we will base your Lab 1 report grade
only on the revised report. Any revised report is due June 21.
 After your Lab 2 report is due, you will complete a peer evaluation of another students’
Lab 2 report. We will select pairs of students at random to complete each other’s review.
Your peer review is due on June 22 and you will be graded on the quality of your review.
Students wishing to resubmit their Lab 2 report based on this feedback may do so; any
revised report is due June 28. We will grade only the final version of your Lab 2 report.
Late reports: Please don’t go there. We are on a tight schedule in the summer and it can be
impossible to catch up if you fall behind. But, for purposes of having a definite policy: late
reports will be docked by 5% for up to two days late, and 10% for two days to one week late.
Reports will not be accepted more than one week late except for documented cases of illness or
family emergency.
Oral report: You will be required to give an oral report on one lab. This is in addition to your
written report on that lab. Oral reports will be conducted June 27-29 on either lab 2 or lab 3
(your choice). These will be one-on-one with the instructor. Reports will be scheduled using the
Canvas calendar, and you must sign up by June 20.
Lab participation/lab book grade: You will receive a lab participation/lab book grade. The
following factors will increase your participation grade: shows up to lab prepared, shows up to lab
on time, actively works on experiment rather than leaning on partner, shows interest and initiative
on experiments, does extra reading on topics, has a careful and methodical approach to
experiments, does more than the minimum measurements required, follows directions, takes good
care not to damage equipment. Also, at the end of the semester you’ll turn your lab book in, and
we’ll base the lab book part of your grade on that.

Religious observance/illness/family emergency: Students are entitled to make up work or to turn
in work late without penalty if this is needed for observance of a religious holy day, illness, or the
serious illness or death of a close family member. Students who wish to exercise this right must
inform us in advance to the extent reasonably feasible. We may ask for documentation of an illness
or family emergency, and set reasonable limits on the make-up time.
Disabilities: Students with disabilities may request appropriate academic accommodations from
the Division of Diversity and Community Engagement, Services for Students with Disabilities,
512-471-6259, http://diversity.utexas.edu/disability/.
Grading: Course grades will be assigned using the following weight factors:
 Bootcamp lab (CR/NC): 3 %
 Homework assignment: 6 %
 Peer review of other student’s report: 3 %
 Oral report: 6 %
 Lab participation: 6 %
 Lab book: 6 %
 Written lab reports (14 pts. each): 70 %
