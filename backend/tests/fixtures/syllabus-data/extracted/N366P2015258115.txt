N366P Spring 2015
Clinical Settings:
1. Opportunities for learning are available at the Dell Children's Medical Center of Central
Texas (DCMC) for the clinical rotation, pediatric clinics, and student health services
(SHS) in area school districts (ISDs).
Teaching/Learning Strategies:
1. Clinical Practicum: The clinical practicum consists of 8 hours Mondays OR Tuesdays
from 0645-1500 OR 1330-2030 at DCMC AND 8 hours on Fridays in schools and/or
clinics. Evening groups may have additional clinical hours to be completed per instructor.
Monday evening and Tuesday evening may have a required assignment on 1 Monday
during the rotation. Students will utilize and demonstrate use of the nursing process in a
variety of settings. The student is expected to integrate and evaluate client’s subjective
and objective health data; assess client’s health status; prioritize client’s health needs;
plan and implement nursing interventions to meet the client’s health needs in a safe,
timely, efficacious manner; and evaluate the effectiveness of nursing interventions.
Students are expected to use developmentally appropriate nursing interventions for
children and families.
2. School health nursing experiences will be carried out in school districts in Central Texas.
Students will be assigned to a school nurse in the elementary, middle school, and/or high
school setting. Outpatient pediatric clinical experiences will take place in clinics in
Austin and surrounding areas. A weekly written narrative/reflection is due each week.
3. Simulation exercises may be included as clinical time (location may vary).
4. Assignments:
a. In-patient - DCMC: Students will be assigned to work with an individual primary
nurse on each day. In cooperation with the primary nurse and instructor, the
student will select one of that nurse’s pts with whom the student will deliver full
nursing care. The instructors will be reviewing student's progress on clinical
behaviors, documentation and written assignments throughout the clinical day and
provide feedback. Clinical narratives will be completed weekly.
b. Students will complete one Nursing Process Report during rotation. NPR should
include 3 nursing diagnoses or problems with goals, interventions, rationale, and
evaluations appropriate to achieve goal outcomes. Each diagnosis or problem
must have a minimum of 2 current evidence-based citations supporting the plan of
care.
c. Simulation, school health and/or outpatient pediatric clinical experiences may
have weekly additional assignments, including episode of care reports, weekly
narratives/reflections, an educational project, and development of an applicable
algorithm.

d. Students complete clinical evaluation tool for self-evaluation.
Evaluation and Grading Policies:
Students are evaluated on the basis of clinical performance including implementation of
teaching/learning strategies.
Clinical Performance at DCMC 40%
Nursing Process Report based on inpatient care 10%
School Health and Outpatient Pediatric Clinical Nursing Performance 40%
(including clinical performance in school and any outpatient settings)
Teaching/educational project based on outpatient setting needs 10%
Total 100%
Course Grade Assignment is as follows:
90-100 = A
80- 89 = B
75- 79 = C
60- 74 = D
0- 59 = F
As indicated on the Clinical Evaluation Tool, the following three criteria are considered
CRITICAL ELEMENTS in the student’s evaluations. If the clinical instructors observe
behaviors, which in their judgments indicate that the student is not meeting any one of these
three criteria at a passing level, the student will not receive a passing grade, regardless of the
behaviors assessed in the remainder of the evaluation tools.
Attendance Policy:
Students are expected to attend all clinical sessions (including orientation, classes in the
Skills Lab or Simulation Lab, and assigned patient care areas in agencies and community
settings). Failure to appear for scheduled clinical practicum sessions and tardiness are
viewed as unprofessional behavior. Students who are absent or tardy may be required to
complete alternate clinical assignments. Students may be dropped from a practicum
course or may receive a failing grade for patterns of absences or tardiness. In the event of
exceptional circumstances, which make it impossible for a student to be present for a
clinical practicum, arrangements must be made with the instructor and the appropriate
clinical agency personnel in advance. Failure to notify the instructor and the clinical
agency in advance (VIA PAGER OR PHONE; NO E-MAIL or TEXT MESSAGES) may
result in a reduction of one letter grade from the final course grade. In addition, call the
assigned clinic, school, in-patient unit or specialty area and notify them of your absence
or delay in arrival. Be sure to note the name and title of the agency’s personnel with
whom you left your message. Students are to stay a total of 8 hours per day in all
clinical settings.

N366P Spring 2015
Notification of absences due to a religious holy day must be given 14 days prior to class
absence. If planned absence is within the first 2 weeks of school, notification must be
given on the first day.
Students with Disabilities:
Refer to the General Information for information on Academic and Program
Accommodations for Students with Disabilities or contact the Services for Students with
Disabilities office in the Office of the Dean of Students at 512-471-6259. The School of
Nursing works to ensure that students who have disabilities have equal access to the
University’s programs and services. If you have any questions about services or
accommodations for students with disabilities, please talk with the faculty member, the
Assistant Dean for Undergraduate Programs, or the Assistant Dean for Student and
Clinical Affairs or directly call the Office of the Dean of Students, Services for Students
with Disabilities, 512-471-6259.
Scholastic Dishonesty Policy:
Refer to the General Information for information on the Scholastic Dishonesty Policy
Sec. 11-802. Scholastic dishonesty includes, but is not limited to cheating, plagiarism,
collusion, falsifying academic records, and misrepresenting facts. The Dean of Students
Office records acts of dishonesty and notifies the School of Nursing of each incident. In
addition to all of the University statements and policies relative to academic dishonesty,
the School of Nursing recognizes the strong link between honesty in academic work and
professional integrity. Any act of academic dishonesty, including fabrication of reports or
records of interactions with clients, is considered incompatible with ethical standards of
nursing practice. The School of Nursing does not admit students who have a record of
violations to the professional sequence. Students who engage in scholastic dishonesty
may be subject to dismissal and may jeopardize their eligibility for licensure as a
registered nurse.
Honor Codes:
The profession of nursing has a legacy of public respect and trust. We provide specialized
care for the health needs of individuals and the community with integrity, honesty,
compassion, and state of the art knowledge and skills. Learning and practicing
responsible and ethical professional behavior is a vital part of professional education. The
Institutional Rules on Student Services and Activities given in the General Information
Catalog (Chapter 11) and The University of Texas at Austin’s Honor Code apply to all
nursing students:
