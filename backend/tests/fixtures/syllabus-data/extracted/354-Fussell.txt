Course Objectives
This is an introductory course on the major topics in the areas of image synthesis, interactive techniques,
geometric modeling, and computer-based animation. The material covered includes
OpenGL programming
principles of operation of raster graphics systems
sampling and antialiasing
homogeneous coordinate transformation techniques
parallel and central projection and perspective transformations
hidden surface removal
light and reflectance models for local and global illumination
shading techniques
ray tracing
basic object modeling techniques

visual perception and basic color theory
hierarchical modeling.
basic animation
Upon course completion, you should have mastered both the mathematical principles of these techniques
and their implementation. Implementation of these techniques will be demonstrated through a series of
programming assignments in C++, in many cases using OpenGL. Your mastery of the mathematical
fundamentals will be exercised through written homework and exams.
Student Evaluation
Your performance in this class will be evaluated through homework assignments, in class quizzes,
programming assignments, and two midterm exams. The weights of each of these components is as
follows:
Exams (2): 30% (15% each)
Homework and quizzes: 10%
Programming Assignments: 60%
There are no makeup exams unless arranged explicitly in advance with the instructor. This will only be
possible for valid non-academic reasons.
Homework assignments will be due at the beginning of lecture on the due date. Programming
assignments will be submitted electronically by 11:59 on the due date and will require you to use your
departmental Linux account. Turnin time will be the time recorded by the turnin program you will use to
turn in the assignments. You may not email your assignments to the teaching staff.
Project submissions will each include a code listing and a written project description, which will include
a description of the software architecture of the system and a user's guide. Grading also generally
involves interactive demonstrations of the programs by the students. Programs will be graded on
correctness, readability, style, and documentation. Program development may be done anywhere, but the
version of the assignments that is turned in and demonstrated must be able to be built and executed on
the publix Linux machines on which software for this course is supported.
You have a "late account" of 3 days for the term which you can spend any way you choose for your
programming assigments. For example, you can turn in three programs one day late each, or one
program 3 days late, without penalty. Once you have exhausted your late account, no late assignments
will be accepted.
Academic Misconduct Policy
You are free to discuss the course material with your classmates and are encouraged to form study
groups for the exams. However, collaboration on homework or programming assignments is not
permitted unless explicitly stated by the instructor. Helping a friend understand the intent of a homework
or programming assignment specification is permitted. Students who work together too closely (e.g.
design their solution together) should be aware that this is a form of cheating called COLLUSION and is
subject to academic penalties. Penalties for academic misconduct include a failing grade in this course.
The homework, programs, and exams must be the work of students turning them in. University policy
(see Dean of Students' policies on academic integrity) will be followed strictly.

Acts that exceed the bounds defined by the approved collaboration practices will be considered cheating.
Such acts include:
Copying solutions, code, or programs from someone else or giving someone else your solutions,
code, or programs
Participation in a discussion group that develops a solution that everyone copies
We urge everyone in the class to take appropriate measures for protecting one's work. You should protect
your files, homework solution sheets, etc. as deemed reasonable.
Studying for tests together is permitted and encouraged. Please come talk to us if you are unsure about
how to work together with your friend in a legal, helpful manner. Remember, it is always ok to "work
together" with your professor or TA!
Your Responsibilities in This Class
You are expected to show up on time for lectures.
You are responsible for all material posted to the web site and sent to the email list. Ignorance of
such material is no excuse.
You are responsible for obtaining a departmental Linux account, and learning the Linux operating
system sufficiently well to meet the demands of the course. You can find on-line Linux guides - a
place to start is here.
You are responsible for all material presented in lecture and in the reading assignments.
Your performance in this class will be determined by you! It will require a strong dedication to
learning the material and may require a substantial time commitment to complete the
programming assignments.
You are responsible for turning in your own work on all assignments. Unauthorized collusion is
not allowed and constitutes a violation of the university's policies on academic integrity. See
above guidelines for more information on what is or is not allowed.
You are responsible for protecting your work from being copied by others.
Programming Infrastructure
The programming assignments will require use of the Department of Computer Sciences instructional
computing resources. All CS students who meet the prerequisites for CS354 are eligible for a CS
departmental lab account. We will be doing projects using OpenGL and C++. User interfaces will be
developed using GLUT or FLTK to make user interface building easier and to make the inferfaces
portable across platforms.
Software needed for your projects is installed on the public Linux machines in the GDC labs. If you
have trouble running the software, please report it to either the instructor or the TA. You can feel free to
download and install the support software we are using on your own machines and work there, but you
will need to turn in programs that work on the public Linux machines. Instructions for using software for
each programming project on the lab machines will be given out with the assignments.
