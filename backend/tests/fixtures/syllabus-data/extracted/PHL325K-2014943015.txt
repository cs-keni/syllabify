Description
Nearly all of us accept that there are some things we morally ought to do, and other
things we morally ought not to do. But only a few of us take the time to ask ourselves,
in a serious and systematic way, what is it about these things that makes them the ones
we morally ought, or ought not, to do. The aim of this class is to help us understand
and evaluate the full range of different possible answers we might want to give to this
question. Readings will be drawn primarily from recent and contemporary work in the
analytic tradition of philosophical ethics, but will also include some material from the
two historical figures who have had perhaps the greatest influence on that tradition —
Immanuel Kant and John Stuart Mill.

Assignments
Ten Quizzes ["% each]
• At the beginning of exactly 11 of our 14 Friday meetings, there will be a short quiz on
the material covered during the preceding Monday and Wednesday meetings of that
week. These quizzes are designed to be easy for you if you have (i) attended the
preceding Monday and Wednesday meetings and (ii) completed the required readings
for those meetings.
• Each completed quiz will be graded on a scale from $ to & (where $=A, !=B, "=C, and
&=D). Each missed quiz — due to unexcused absence, for example — will receive a %
(where % = F).
• Your lowest quiz grade will be dropped.
• You may make up a quiz grade of D or F by submitting a "-! page response paper, no
later than two weeks after the date of that quiz, on a topic chosen in advance by Matt.
You may not make up more than two quiz grades total.
Two Short Papers (!-# pages) [&#% each]
• The first paper will be due on Friday, September 26th; the second will be due on
Friday, October 24th.
• Each paper will be graded and returned to you no later than two weeks after it is due.
• Recommended topics for each short paper will be distributed approximately two weeks
before it is due.
• Late submissions will be penalized one-third of a letter grade for each day they are late.
• If you receive a grade of B- or lower on one of your short papers, you may submit a
rewritten version of that paper no later than one week after the day it is returned to you.
The grade you receive on the rewritten version will replace the original grade.
One Term Paper (&%-&# pages) [$%%]
• The first draft of your term paper will be due on Monday, November 24th; the final
version will be due on Monday, December 15th.
• The first draft of your term paper will graded pass/fail, and will be returned to you with
comments no later than Wednesday, December 3rd.
• The topic for your term paper will be up to you, but will be subject to Matt’s approval
and suggested modifications. You must confer with him (over email, during office hours,
or by appointment) at least once — and no later than Monday, November 3rd — to
discuss your proposed term paper topic. Failure to do so will result in a loss of one full letter
grade on your final term paper grade.
• Late submissions (of either the first draft or the final version) will result in a loss of one-
third of a letter grade, on your final term paper grade, for each day they are late.
Participation [&%%]
• The purpose of the Friday discussion meetings is to give you an opportunity to engage
with the course material, and with each other, in a more active and collaborative manner
than is possible during the lecture meetings. Your participation grade will be based on
the quantity and quality of your contributions to these meetings.
• At the end of each (normal) week, "-$ students will volunteer (or be chosen) to be the
designated DISCUSSION LEADERS for the following week. Discussion leaders are
expected to be prepared to ask and answer questions related to the material covered
during the Monday and Wednesday meetings of that week. They are encouraged (but
not required) to confer with each other outside of class — either online or in person —
prior to the discussion meeting they are scheduled to lead. Each student in the class will
be assigned to be a discussion leader for exactly " discussion meetings during the term.
