7. Determine information from a graph, and construct a graph from given data.
8. Be familiar with measurement scales. Tell the process by which numbers are converted from
one unit of measurement to another; for example, how to convert meters to inches or cm3 to liters.
Be able to estimate.
9. From linear dimensions, calculate the volume of a sphere or the volume of a cube. Calculate
density from a given mass and volume.
10. Distinguish between elements, compounds, homogeneous mixtures, and heterogeneous
mixtures. Describe the differences between solid, liquid, and gas samples of a pure substance.
11. Understand the basic organization of the periodic table. Use the table to determine atomic
mass and atomic number, find elements with similar properties based on location within the table.
12. Identify the parts of an atom and the number of protons and electrons in atoms and ions.
Determine the number of valence electrons in the elements H, C, N and O, which are important in
biological molecules.
13. Define isotope.
14. On the basis of relative electronegativities of elements, predict whether a compound is
covalent or ionic. Predict polarity of covalent bonds within molecules.
15. Calculate the molar mass of a compound from information in the periodic table. Calculate
molarity given moles (or mass) and volume.
16. Define pH and explain the difference between two solutions, one with pH 2 and the other with
pH 5.
17. Define kinetic energy and potential energy, and give examples of both.
18. State the first and second law of thermodynamics.
19. Describe the cell theory, and distinguish between the two major types of cells.
Objectives for this course: The emphasis of this course is to be able to remember and
understand the details and be able to understand it well to be able to apply to new
situations. Some general objectives are given below:
1. Dynamic hierarchical organization of life, compartmentalization: organelles,
enzyme pathway and membrane localization, molecular turnover; diffusion, water
balance, surface area
2. Chemical bonds: their significance within macromolecules and in the interactions
among molecules

3. Specific recognition, communication, response: Specificity of protein binding,
receptor proteins, signal transduction systems, cell-cell communication, cellular
response to signals.
4. Energy transformation: free-energy changes in organisms; energy-coupled
processes in cellular respiration and photosynthesis; ATP-ADP cycles, energy
flow in ecosystems
5. Enzyme regulation: feedback control, activators and inhibitors of enzyme
function.
6. Heredity: continuity of genetic information: transmission to the next generation,
mutation; differential gene expression, gene structure and genomics
7. Structure-function relationship at all levels: protein, membrane, cell, organ.
Relationship between structure and function is a product of evolution by natural
selection. Evolution is the process that explains both the unity and diversity of
life.
8. Processes of science: Science building & using models; observations &
experiments; asking questions. Our knowledge of the biological world is
predicated upon the ongoing process of hypothesis and experimentation
Lecture presentation slides: Material will be presented in class in the form of power point
slides. Selected slides will be uploaded on Blackboard at http://courses.utexas.edu under “Course
documents” and students can access this class using their UT EID. Students will need to take
additional notes in class in order to supplement information on slides.
Classroom courtesy: Please help us all concentrate on learning biology in the classroom: be on
time to class, turn all cell phones to off, stay off the internet, avoid leaving early, and minimize
distracting conversation. Thank you - your classmates and I will appreciate it.
Class attendance: is required and class participation encouraged! Attendance will be taken after
the first day of class, and will be used to assess student’s performance in the course. We have
found a strong correlation between a student’s overall performance and attendance. A student
during class found to be engaged in non-class related activities (talking, reading the newspaper,
surfing the web etc) may be marked as absent from class.
Portions of the material relevant to exams will be emphasized during class; such information may
not be present in slide presentations, hence it is in the student’s best interest to attend class
regularly. If you must miss a lecture, review the slides, do the required reading and check with at
least one other classmate who attended the lecture for any additional notes. After you have done
this, you may also make arrangements with your lecturer or T.A. to review the material you
missed.
iClicker: We will be using the iClicker – a type of classroom response/assessment system to help
with the learning and teaching process. Please purchase the iClicker at the Co-op. You can
register it at www.iclicker.com using the number provided at the back of the iClicker (for Clicker
ID) as well as your UT EID (for student ID). Bring your iClicker to class every day. Most classes

will have questions that will require you use the iClicker. It is your responsibility, to make sure
that the batteries are functional and that the iClicker is in proper working order. Participation in
iClicker questions in class will earn you up to 2% extra credit. You may miss up to 3 classes
and still receive full credit. We will start counting iClickers from Monday, June 6.
Discussion sections: will be conducted by the T.A. She will review major concepts covered in
class. Each student is expected to attend a discussion section assigned to him or her by the unique
number. Practice worksheets and Quizzes will be given in some discussion sections. Quizzes may
be in the form of multiple choice and/or short answers. You are allowed to make up ONE missed
quiz at the convenience of the T.A.
Discussion sections startthe week of June 6
Please attend the discussion you are registered for based on your unique number.
Homework: Homework assignments will be posted on Bb every Friday. Bring your
COMPLETED homework to discussion section for submission. Questions regarding homework
should be addressed in discussion sections. Further details will be provided by the TA in
discussion.
Announcements: Important announcements by the lecturer or the T.A. may be made during
class/discussion. It is the student’s responsibility to be aware of these announcements. Some last
minute changes in schedule may be posted on Blackboard. Students are encouraged to regularly
check Blackboard and email for these postings.
Read the assigned material in the textbook: The powerpoints for each week will be posted on
Blackboard. Reading assignments from the text will also be indicated on the powerpoint slides.
Read the assigned text pages and go over the powerpoints before coming to class. There may be
material in the text which was not covered in lecture and for which you are responsible, so make
sure to take notes in class. Additionally, the combination of listening to a lecture, reviewing the
slides and your notes, and reading the text will make it easier for you to understand and remember
the material. Practice Self quizzes at the end of each chapter will provide a good review of the
concepts and help students tackle both memory based as well as application questions on the
exam.
Exams: There will be TWO in-class midterm exams and one comprehensive final exam. The
exams cannot be missed or turned in late unless permission is granted in advance for
extraordinary, documented circumstances. For such students make up exams can be scheduled at
an “earlier” date but ONLY with PRIOR approval. Student I.D.s will be checked at exams.
Exams will include some memory based as well as some thinking/application based questions.
Students may not leave the room during an exam. If you need to leave the room, please hand in
the exam first. Make sure all books, backpacks are placed at the side of the room and cell
phones/pagers turned off. Make sure to come to all the exams on time. No late comers will be
allowed to take the exam especially if a student has already taken the exam and left the exam
room.
Once exams are graded and returned, students will get up to three days to evaluate the exam for
any errors in grading/adding up points. After which NO regrade requests will be entertained.
Exams written in pencil will not be eligible for regrading.

Final grade based upon:
(1) Discussion section Quizzes, Activities: contribute to 15% of the final grade (60 points total).
Further information will be provided by T.A. in discussion.
(2) Home work worksheets: Weekly home work will be assigned which will contribute to 5% of
the final grade (up to 20 points completion and submission grade)
(3) Two midterm exams each worth 100 points. You can earn a maximum of 200 points - for
50% of your final grade (i.e. 25% per exam)
(4) Comprehensive final exam worth 120 points - for 30% of your final grade.
(5) Extra Credit for using iClicker: up to 2%
Grading: We will be adopting the plus/minus grading system this semester. Your grade will be
based on the following rubric:
Grade Percent
A 93.50-100
A- 90.00-93.49
B+ 86.50-89.99
B 83.50-86.49

D+ 66.50-69.99
D 63.50-66.49
D- 60.00-63.49
F 59.99 and below
The grade categories MAY be slightly modified to reflect the overall performance of the
class, but this is not a guarantee. This will only be decided at the end of the semester. DO
NOT COUNT ON A CURVE OR CATEGORY ADJUSTMENT TO RAISE YOUR
GRADE.
Helpful hints to do well in this class:
1) Make sure to read the assigned chapters ahead of time as well as after the lecture.
2) Come to class regularly, on time and pack only after the bell rings or lecture ends.
3) When not clear, ask questions! You can ask questions in class, after class or in
discussion.
4) Do not hesitate to come to office hours for further help with concepts.
5) FORM STUDY GROUPS! The best way to understand concepts is to explain these to
your friends. If you need help forming study groups consult with T.A.
6) Do not doze off or sleep during class! Stay alert by taking notes and participating in class

7) Turn off cell phones/pagers.
8) Do not read newspapers or surf the web during class
9) Read to understand, remember key terms, and learn how to apply course information
10) A Study guide will be provided prior to each exam. Use these as a guide to learn and
understand concepts to study for exams.
11) After each exam, analyze results to see how you can improve in the next exam
12) Make sure to talk to the instructor or the T.A. as soon as you have trouble with the
course. DO NOT wait until the last minute to get assistance!
Policy on scholastic dishonesty: Students who violate University rules on scholastic dishonesty
are subject to disciplinary penalties, including the possibility of failure in the course and/or
dismissal from the university. Since such dishonesty harms the individual, all students, and the
integrity of the university, policies on scholastic dishonesty will be strictly enforced.
