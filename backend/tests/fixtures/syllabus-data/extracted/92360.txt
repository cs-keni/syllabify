Prerequisite and degree relevance: The prerequisite is one of M408D, M408M or the equiv-
alent, with a grade of at least C-, or consent of instructor. (Credit may not be received for both
M341andM340L.Majorswitha“math”advisingcodemustregisterforthisratherthanforM340L;
majors without a “math” advising code must register for M340L. Math majors must make a grade
of at least C in M341.)
Course description: This course has three purposes: an overview of elementary linear algebra,
introduction to proofs and developing proof skills and finally an introduction to mathematical ab-
straction and provide a necessary prerequisite for a number of upper division courses.
We will try to cover the first five chapters of the text, but some of the sections and some of the
material within some sections will be omitted. See below for a list of topics covered in the class.
