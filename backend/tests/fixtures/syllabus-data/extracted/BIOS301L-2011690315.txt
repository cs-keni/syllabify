90320 MW 2:00pm – 3:00pm RLM 5.118
Course Descriptions:
Introduction to cell biology, including cell types, cellular organization, physiology,
microorganisms as cells and organisms, viruses; molecular biology and genetics,
including DNA replication, transcription and translation, gene action, Mendelian
genetics, immune processes; organismal biology, including structure, organization,
physiology and development of animals (emphasis on human biology) and plants.
Required Text: Biology: Life on Earth, by Audesirk, Audesirk, and Byers(8th ed.)
Recommended supplement:
Study Guide for Biology - Life on Earth (ISBN: 0-13-195769-4)
Exams and Grading:
The exams will cover both lecture material and assigned reading in the text.
There will be three one-hour exams given during the regular class time, each of which
will count 25% of a student’s grade. The final will be a comprehensive exam; this will
count 25% of the grade. All exams are multiple choices. Grades will be assigned as
follow:
A = 90-100 B = 80-89 C = 70-79 D = 60-69 F = 59 or below
Academic Integrity
Students who violate University rules are subject to disciplinary penalties. Refer to the Student
Judicial Services Website http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/
Scholastic dishonesty will not be tolerated. Students who violate University rules
on scholastic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary penalties, including the possibility of
failure in the course and dismissal from the University. Since dishonesty harms the
individual, all students, and the integrity of the University, policies on scholastic
dishonesty will be strictly enforced. A UT ID must be presented in order to turn in any
exam. Only those students with written medical excuses (signed by a doctor) will be
automatically to make up an exam.

Lectures
Attendance will not be taken in lectures. As my exams will be drawn mainly
from the lectures, it is important that you be here. I suggest you exchange phone
numbers, so if you miss a class, you can get the notes. You will always be responsible
for what happens in class, including the announcements, handouts, and academic
material.
Discussion Sections
The discussion sections will go over lecture and reading material; each will cover
lectures of previous time.
Participation is not mandatory. However, attendance will be taken and your final
grade will be raised 2 points for adequate attendance.
For example: 75, 85, 74, and 78
Then, Average = 78 + 2 = 80 (cid:1) B
Discussion sections start this Wednesday.
Student Accommodation Policy
Students with disabilities who believe that they may need accommodations in this class are
encouraged to contact the Office of Students with Disabilities at (OSD phone# 471 6259, office
SSB 4.104 on 100B West Dean Keeton St) as soon as possible and bring the documentation. For
more information, visit http://www.utexas.edu/depts/dos/ssd/.
Final Exam: Monday, August 15, 2:00–5:00 pm (location to be announced)
No excuses to take the exam early or later will be accepted. If the final exam is
missed, an F or an X will be given as the final symbol, depending upon the circumstances.
