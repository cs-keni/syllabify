CS 433/533: Computer & Network Security
Winter 2026
Course Description
Asbothascienceandanart,computerandnetworksecurityhasbecomeoneofthosemust-learndisciplines.
This course will be comprehensive, covering both fundamental security topics and practical solutions. Yet,
it is designed to be manageable for effective learning. Twenty lectures over ten weeks are designed for this
class. Here are sample topics (each with a sample question):
• Elementary cryptography (what is the difference between classic cryptography and public-key cryp-
tography?)
• Program security (why virus/worm/Trojan horses are rampant on computer and networks?)
• Protection in general-purpose operating systems (what is access control of memory/address/file/user
account?)
• Designing trusted operating systems (can virtualization or layered design help secure an OS?)
• Security in networks (can a firewall deal with all network security threats?)
• Privacy (Is your email or web visits protected with good privacy?)
• Administering security (how to conduct risk analysis and design your security policies?)
• Legal and ethical issues in computer security (now that we catch an attacker, so what?)
Prerequisites
• CS 415 (Operating Systems) for CS 433; CS 432 Recommended

Textbooks and Readings
• Textbook: Security in Computing, 6th edition, by Charles P. Pfleeger, Shari Lawrence Pfleeger and
Lizzie Coles-Kemp. ISBN-10: 0137891210.
• Slides: Class slides will be provided on Canvas as soon as they are available.
Expected Learning Outcomes
Upon successful completion of the course, students will be able to:
• Understand basic concepts of cryptography, including classic and public key cryptography and use of
encryption;
• Understand fundamental concepts and issues with program security, including buffer overflow, com-
puter viruses, and countermeasures against program threats;
• Becomefamiliarwithsecuritymethodsofordinaryoperatingsystems(OS)andconceptsandmethods
for trusted OS;
• Become aware ofthreats in networks andbecome familiarwith common methods in securingnetworks
and communications, including firewalls and security protocols;
• Understand basic concepts with cloud computing security;
• Grasp essential concepts with security administration, legal and ethical security issues, and privacy;
and
• Developedexperienceinworkingonaterm-longclassproject, includingskillsrangingfromidentifying
a topic, developing a plan, and executing the plan.
Acquired Skills
Upon successful completion of the course, students will have acquired the following essential skills:
• Identifying an interesting security project topic and developing a plan for carrying out the project;
• Exercising a systematic approach to a security problem;
• Improved skills in programming and data analysis; and
• Improved team work and presentation skills.
Estimated Student Workload
The workload of this course is expected to be as follows.
• Class attendance and participation. Students should attend the lectures and actively participate in
the class, including raising questions and participating discussions.
• Course review and homework.
– Students should carefully review the class materials after the class.
– There will be 3-4 homeworks throughout the term.
2

• Class project. Every student is required to form a team of 2 or 3 students to work on a class project
(3 for CS 433 and 2 for CS 533 with exception request to TA). With the help of the professor and the
TA, every team will identify an interesting problem related to the course material, design, implement,
and evaluate a solution, and write a project report.
Warning: The class project can be a lot of fun, but can be also time-demanding. Start ASAP.
• Midterm: February 19, 2026, in class.
• No Final Exam.

A Excellent. Solid grasp of concepts, approaches, and/or skills introduced or used in this course.
Very well prepared to apply this knowledge to future studies or employment.
B Verygood. Generallygoodgraspofconcepts,approaches,and/orskillsintroducedorusedinthis
course. Prepared to apply this knowledge to future studies or employment.
C Pass. Basic grasp of concepts, approaches, and/or skills introduced or used in this course. Mini-
mally prepared to apply this knowledge to future studies or employment.
D No Pass (Earns UO credit). Demonstrated grasp of concepts, approaches, and/or programming
skills introduced or used in this course is not yet sufficient to apply this knowledge to future
studies or employment.
F No Pass (No credit). Little or no demonstrated grasp of concepts, approaches, and/or program-
ming skills introduced or used in this course, and/or failure to carry out much of the required
work.
A+ Distinction. A+ grades will be given only in cases where the student has excelled in all course
topics and overall performance is distinctly better than that required for an A grade.

Course Policies
Class attendance
We apply a “reason-neural” class attendance policy in that we will not ask for reasons for absences, except
for disability-related accommodations, religious observances, university-sponsored events, and cases where
students have Emergency Academic Notification through the Dean of Students. In those cases, it is up to
the student to ask for accommodations for these reasons and provide the necessary documentation prior to
missing class or turning in late work, usually at the beginning of the term.
A student may miss up to two classes with no impact on their grade; an exception can be made in
extraordinary circumstances by emailing a request (without disclosing details) to the TA.
We will randomly check student class attendance using quizzes, class photos, or attendance sheet. For
each 10% of no attendance record beyond the first 10%, the student will lose 10% of class participation
points.

GenAI Use
StudentscanuseGenAItoolsinthisclasstohelpwithcertainaspectsofcourseworkandassignments. This
includes reviewing course materials, brainstorming ideas, creating a paper outline, or summarizing findings
of research articles in the literature. However, you cannot use content such as text or graphics created by
GenAI tools in your work; rather, you must be the author/creator of your work submissions. For example,
you can use a GenAI tool to suggest a paper outline based on a draft you provide it, but you cannot submit
a paper with part or all of its text generated by GenAI as if the text is your own writing. Be advised, in
accordance with UO policy, if I believe you’ve handed in work created in whole or in part by GenAI tools,
I may submit a report of suspected academic misconduct to the Office of Student Conduct and Community
Standards for that office to make a determination of responsibility and, if warranted, assess a grade penalty.
So, if you are in doubt or have questions about a particular GenAI tool and if its use is okay, check in with
me or TA and let’s discuss!
