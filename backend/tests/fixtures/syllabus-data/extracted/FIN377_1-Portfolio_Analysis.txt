COURSE OVERVIEW:
The pre-requisite for this course is FIN367, Investment Theory. FIN377-1, Portfolio Analysis and Management,
is a course overview of the areas of portfolio management and security analysis. Topics covered include
portfolio theory, risk management, performance evaluation, and behavioral finance and market anomalies. In
addition, we will review the valuation, correlations, and performance of various asset classes—fixed income,
stocks, real estate and commodities. The course will look at different types of funds and models of investing—
hedge funds, endowment funds, pension funds, and the various assets they hold including PE investments. To
be able to understand different types of hedge funds and risk management techniques the course will include
sections on futures and options. Portfolio Analysis and Management is designed for upper-level finance majors
to provide them with advanced skills in financial markets, security analysis and portfolio management.
Students get hands-on practice at selecting securities and managing a portfolio using Stock-trak, an investment
simulation product in “real time”. The instructor will provide each group with $1,000,000 to manage in the stock
portfolio (long only), $500,000 in the long-short fund and $200,000 in the futures fund. The instructor will guide
you toward building a portfolio of investments that will include the following securities: domestic and foreign
stock, bonds, real estate and / or commodities. You will also set up portfolios to help you learn about hedge
funds and how futures and options trade and are used in asset management. The professor gives portfolio
requirements with which your group need comply so that you build a portfolio that accomplishes the intended
objective. In small groups, you will undertake current financial research to decide which securities you will hold
(or short) in your funds. Additional features that students practice include the use of stop and limit orders as
well as leverage and short selling.
In this course a combination of methods is utilized with special emphasis on student involvement. Some of the
methods are: lecture, case review, spreadsheet modeling in Excel, working with financial center data feeds
(Bloomberg and Fact Set), group meetings and research outside of class, and discussion of current financial
events. Class attendance is very important; students who attend regularly tend to do better. The professor
utilizes the lecture format to introduce key topics, to demonstrate financial models & techniques, and to guide
students in their portfolio projects. Students take an active part in this class; you will likely find that the level of
learning depends on your effort level both during class and outside of class. Group members are encouraged to
assist one another and learn from one another. The emphasis on student involvement encourages students to
learn by doing and encourages the self-motivation so important to the workplace. If a student is unable to fulfill
his or her commitment to the group, he or she may be asked by the professor to complete assignments alone
perhaps with a slight extension and with a full grade downgrade.
EXPECTATIONS: PROFESSIONAL CLASSROOM & GROUP CONDUCT:
Professional behavior is expected in the classroom and will help us have a rewarding and enjoyable learning
experience. Arriving on time, excellent attendance, being attentive and participating are all essential for the
success of the class. When class starts, all of us will cease side conversations and focus time allotted on
classroom material. Electronic devices are prohibited during class; this includes checking text messages under
backpacks or your desk. Computers are used only if required by professor during part or all of a class. Two
combinations of the following will count as a zero for the day: using electronic devices, late arrival to class,
leaving or walking around during class, and leaving prior to the end of class. In order for an absence to be
marked as excused, you will need to send me the original email regarding an interview or some sort of an
attachment via email. If the absence meets the university requirements for an excused absence, then it will be
2

recorded as excused. It is up to you to manage your schedule and arrive on time to keep excused absences to
three or fewer over the term. If you wish to have one unexcused absence for reasons not covered under
university policy, then keep excused absences down to two or fewer.
In addition, you are expected to attend and arrive on time to group meetings and contribute in a meaningful and
productive way to all group work. If a student is not able to meet his or her commitments, the other group
members shall notify the professor as soon as possible. In accordance with academic integrity, students may
not earn credit for work to which they have not contributed at a reasonable level; if someone in your group has
not contributed at a meaningful level, leave his or her name off the project or presentation and then email me to
call my attention to the issue. Once I am aware of the issue, the student may be redirected, receive partial or
zero credit, and / or be permitted to do the group work as a single student. Adherence to the above expectations
regarding professional behavior helps ensure a high participation / evaluation grade. Inability to meet these
expectations will lead to a lowering of the final participation / evaluation grade.
EVALUATION:
Final grades will be determined as follows:
In-Class Assignments (Individual) / Attendance 10%
Many days the professor will give students in-class assignments, often Excel models, which the instructor helps
lead students through. Though each student must complete his or her own work, students should in fact work in
a collaborative fashion and help one another.
Assignments are due by canvas upload at the end of class (although occasionally or possibly on occasion
turned in hard copy). The professor will drop the lowest grade (or possibly two depending on the number
assigned). The student should save his or her completed spreadsheet prior to upload and name the file, if
possible, by last name. Do not ask to use another student’s work nor send your completed file to another
student.
The grading scheme is as follows:
In class, submitted on time, best effort basis, (defined as about 80% or more correct) = full credit
In class, submitted up to a day late, best effort basis, (defined as about 80% or more correct) = 80%
Not in class, submitted on time, best effort basis, (defined as about 80% or more correct) = 70%
Not in class, submitted up to a day late, best effort basis, (defined as about 80% or more correct) = 60%
Up to 2 days late = 40%; later than that no credit
Not completed on best efforts basis or not very well done = 40%
Post blank spreadsheet = 0 (and possible 50% reduction on next posting)
Shared or used someone else’s spreadsheet = zero not just for assignment but for entire category
If a case discussion short paper is assigned prior to a class, similar policies will apply in terms of evaluation.
Portfolio Projects: 1st Paper (Group Grade though possibly Individual Grade) 10%
The first paper is a group Portfolio Assignment that includes a series of three papers submitted in one
document. The series corresponds to the three group funds— Stock Fund (Long), Long / Short Hedge Fund,
and Dedicated Futures (& Options) Fund. You will spend time in groups researching and setting up these three
funds under the direction of the professor who provides you with the portfolio rules and necessary spreadsheets.
Funds will be invested in stock-trak by the due date and form the basis of the 1st paper. In your group paper for
each fund, include a one to two page write-up, at least two exhibit pages, and then a works cited listing research
undertaken. Since you are including four or more pages each of the three papers (including exhibits and works
cited), the entire project paper will be about 12 pages or longer (including the exhibits and works cited). The
paper is submitted by canvas upload (and hard copy may be required if professor announces so), and will be
graded on completeness and correctness, professional nature of the exhibits, and how well it is researched and
3

written. See additional documents regarding the paper and policies as well as the university policy on academic
honesty.
A student must contribute in a fair way toward the portfolio set-up and toward the research and writing to submit
as part of the group. If any student is not able to uphold this commitment, he or she shall simply work alone on
a portfolio and / or on the first paper and receive a one-letter downgrade.
First, In-Class Test (Individual Grade) 22.5%
The first test will be given about half way through the term. The test will consist of a multiple choice section
counting for about 40% of the test grade and a problem solving / analysis / short essay counting for about 60%
of the grade. The test will evaluate students’ understanding of all material covered to date including: material
learned from preparing and discussing the cases; theory, application and interpretation related to portfolio
management topics; articles covered in class discussion; and your hands-on experience from working in the
trading center. To do well on tests, it is important to attend class, read material prior to class, review class
notes, work through problems from the problem set and review excel spreadsheets. Though the problem set
may not be collected and graded, many of the short problems and analysis are related to your successful
completion of the problem set which is posted on-line with the solutions. Think of the problem set as a type of
practice test for the problem section of the test.
On test day, you should arrive 5 to 10 minutes early if possible, and bring a financial calculator, a pencil and one
side of one page of notes. The one-sided page should be handwritten with any tips, formulas or short examples
that are helpful to you but shall not include long portions of copying; the notes page is to help you learn and do
better on the test and not just copy and paste. In the case that a test is missed with an excused absence
approved by the Dean’s office, the student will take a cumulative final at the end of the term.
Second, In-Class Test (Individual Grade) 22.5%
The second test is given near the end of the term. The test will consist of a multiple choice section counting for
about 40% of the test grade and a problem solving / analysis / short essay counting for about 60% of the grade.
Test questions will primarily focus on material covered after the first test; it will be cumulative only in so far as
the course material is cumulative. The test will evaluate students’ understanding of all material covered to date
including: material learned from preparing and discussing the cases; theory, application and interpretation
related to portfolio management topics; articles covered in class discussion; and your hands-on experience from
working in the trading center. To do well on tests, it is important to attend class, read material prior to class,
review class notes, work through problems from the problem set and review excel spreadsheets. Though the
problem set may not be collected and graded, many of the short problems and analysis are related to your
successful completion of the problem set which is posted on-line with the solutions. Think of the problem set as
a type of practice test for the problem section of the test.
On test day, you should arrive 5 to 10 minutes early if possible, and bring a financial calculator, a pencil and one
side of one page of notes. The one-sided page should be handwritten with any tips, formulas or short examples
that are helpful to you but shall not include long portions of copying; the notes page is to help you learn and do
better on the test and not just copy and paste. In the case that a test is missed with an excused absence
approved by the Dean’s office, the student will take a cumulative final at the end of the term.
Final Portfolio Project Paper (Group Grade though possibly Individual Grade) 20%
This paper takes the place of the cumulative final so you should look at the due date written on the syllabus
schedule instead of consulting the final exam catalog. In groups, students set up, at the beginning of the term, a
basic portfolio in stocks, a long-short hedge fund, and a futures hedge fund. In the basic diversified portfolio,
students set up a growth or value style fund and select approximately 30 stocks representing different sectors.
In the long-short hedge fund students use leverage and take both long and short positions; most students prefer
4

net long portfolios though a few do set up market neutral funds. In the long short hedge fund, students may
invest in stocks only or may select ETFs on bonds, real estate, commodities or volatility. In the dedicated futures
(and options) fund, students will be long or short several futures contracts as well as one or more options.
Students previously submitted the first paper detailing positions and research. In the final paper, students shall
analyze the performance of the funds over the term. Analysis of portfolio statistics and performance shall be
demonstrated by way of exhibits. The paper must display evidence of research in the attached works cited
pages. References used may be recent articles from the Wall Street Journal, Economist, etc. The paper will
entail: approximately 12 pages written, 12 or more exhibit pages, and a page or more of references. The paper
is submitted by canvas upload (and hard copy may be required if professor announces so), and will be graded
on strength of analysis, demonstration of your understanding and ability to apply concepts learned in the course,
strength of exhibits in applying course concepts and skills, and how well it is written. See additional documents
regarding the paper and policies as well as the university policy on academic honesty.
A student must contribute in a fair way toward the portfolio set-up and toward the research and writing to submit
as part of the group. If any student is not able to uphold this commitment, he or she shall simply work alone on
the final paper and receive a one-letter downgrade.
Professor Evaluation / Participation & Peer Review (Individual Grade) 15%
Class participation is based on the contribution of each student to the class as a whole and to the group efforts.
Solid performance in this area depends on: consistent attendance; being actively engaged when we are doing
in-class assignments, demonstration that you are prepared for class; effort level toward group papers and
presentations; strong reviews by peers in their evaluations; and adherence to class policies (see below for class
policies including prohibition of improper use of electronics during class). To be prepared for class, read the
case prior to class. Also, take an active part in case analyses in class by giving your answer or opinion, solving
problems, and suggesting solutions. Also submitting required peer reviews helps you with participation while
failing to submit your self and peer reviews leads to a 20-point downgrade for each one not submitted.
For most students, participation serves as a slight curve toward the final grade. After all components prior to
this one have been scored, the grades are combined to provide an “objective average” or “starting point” grade
for participation. Students with strong attendance, professional conduct and committed participation in group
work will receive this grade or higher (up to a letter grade) for the participation grade. Strong attendance is
defined as attending ninety percent or more of class periods unless excused by university policy*; ninety percent
or better attendance equates to three or fewer absences. A student with poor attendance (missing more than
20% of class periods—six or more classes), or poor effort in group work, or anyone who is disruptive /
unprofessional earns a zero. Thus the grade in this final category may range from zero to a grade of A or 96 or
perhaps higher. The vast majority of students—those with good class performance and solid participation,
receive an A or B for the participation curve. This last component, if high, tends to help students on the
borderline—for example a grade of 79 prior to participation will likely result in a final grade of an 80.
*Any two combinations of the following will count as an absence: using electronics, late arrival to class, leaving
during class, leaving prior to the end of class. Students who attend 90% or better are entitled to any curve if one
is needed in the class; those with lower attendance than 90% do not qualify for any potential curve.
Final Letter Grades
Final letter grades will be determined so that a class G.P.A. of approximately 3.4 is obtained. This G.P.A. is
within the recommendations provided by the UPO office and the department of finance curriculum committee.
Let me give you a general idea of what such a G.P.A. could imply. If about 40% of the class were assigned
grades distributed equally over A- and A and about 60% of the class were assigned grades of B+, B, and B-,
then the class average G.P.A. would be almost a 3.4. The instructor for the course does not, though,
necessarily adhere to a specific percentage breakdown of A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+ and the like. Since this is an
elective course, most terms very few students earn grades in the C, D or F range but it does happen. Usually
these are cases of poor peer evaluations, poor attendance, and missed work. Thus the example given was for
illustrative purposes to help you understand one way a 3.4 average G.P.A. might be achieved. Since class
5

grades will be assigned based on this method and no number cutoffs are given, the professor for the course will
attempt to post on occasion approximate grade cutoffs. Soon after grades for the first short paper and first test
have been posted, the professor will share with the class what the grade assignments would be if given on that
day. This information is for illustrative purposes and so that students may get a general sense of where they
stand in terms of evaluation. Note again, the guidelines posted are general and apply only to those who have
strong participation and peer review. If an upward curve is needed on tests or final grades, only those with
strong attendance and peer evaluation are eligible to receive the curve. Grade assignments and cutoffs may
change by the end of the term depending on new items submitted.
Deviations from Academic Honesty / Not Pulling Weight in Groups and Negative Effect on Grades
Deviations from Academic Honesty on a test or on a paper will be forwarded to the Dean of Students office with
a recommendation of zero on the item in question and the penalty of another full letter downgrade in the
student’s final average. Since academic dishonesty cases are not tolerated and result in clear downgrades, it is
worth me reminding you that guessing on a test (or turning a paper in late and taking a downgrade) is a much
better option than academic dishonesty.
Students are expected to contribute in an approximately equal fashion to all group assignments. In a group of
four, for example, it may not be the case that everyone contributes exactly equally at 25% of the final product on
a particular assignment. If, however, a group member contributes either nothing or does contribute something
but it is small relative to peers, then academic integrity would require you to do two things: one, leave that
student’s name off the work and two, send an email to the instructor notifying her of the situation. The instructor
for the course most often will decide to remove a student from a group if the group is experiencing challenges.
In the case of little or no contribution, the student may receive a zero or she or he may be permitted to do the
entire project on his own with a letter downgrade.
Various Class Policies
Electronics—I follow the department of finance policy on the use of electronics in class. This policy states that
use of any electronic advices or tools (laptops, cell phones, etc.) during class is prohibited unless specifically
requested by the professor of the class. This means that laptops are closed and all other devices are put away
prior to the start of class; students shall not initiate nor receive text messages during class nor have phones out
charging during class. If we need computers for class, the professor will at times permit computer use and at
other times require computers closed or turned off. Adherence to this policy facilitates the students’ abilities to
process class material and helps lead to a solid participation grade; failure to follow the policy disrupts the class
and leads to a poor participation grade.
Test Times-- I adopt class policies that encourage students to keep up on material such that with attendance
and solid time management, students should find themselves adequately prepared to be able to study and take
exams. You are required to take exams at the scheduled date unless you have a university excused absence.
If you know you will have a university excused absence, contact me ahead of time to see if something can be
arranged prior to take the test early. Submit documentation to verify. No make-up exam is offered after the test.
If you miss an exam and have a university excused absence, you will be offered a cumulative exam at the end
of the term.
Test Review after the Test— Once tests are graded and ready to be reviewed, I will have a three week period
when you may review your test during office hours. To be able to review your test, please stop by during that
period.
Accommodations—I follow the university policy on special accommodations and am happy to work with you on
this matter. At the beginning of the term or prior to the first major project or test, please submit to me a letter
prepared by the Service office listed above. Then, email three business days ahead of the scheduled test
reminding me of the nature of the accommodation and the time that you can start (keeping in mind you must
end by 4:30pm) so that we can make arrangements.
6

Attendance at your section – You are required to attend your own section. Attendance at the other section is
not permitted. One exception to this rule is allowed per term (per student) if the student submits a request prior
to the class and the instructor is able to accommodate the request. No guarantees are made on
accommodating such a request since most days require attendance at your section.
Documenting a family emergency—The office of the Dean of Students is able to provide student services that
can assist you in the event of a family emergency. To get that assistance and to document that situation with
me as your faculty member, look at the following web address for how to proceed:
deanofstudents.utexas.edu/emergency/.
Late Work and Presentation Arrival– The policy on work submitted late for major work (projects, papers, peer
evaluations, etc.): 1 second to 10 minutes late = -8 points; 10 minutes to 20 minutes = -15; after 20 minutes
email professor regarding issue and intended turn in, 20 minute mark to 1 day = -25; each day later than 24
hours = original -25 plus -15 for each day.
