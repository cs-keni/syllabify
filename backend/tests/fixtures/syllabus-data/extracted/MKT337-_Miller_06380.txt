REQUIRED TEXT
This class will study Essentials of Marketing, 17th Edition by William Perreault, Joseph Cannon,
and E. Jerome McCarthy. You may use either the hardcover (ISBN 9781260260373) or
paperback (ISBN 9781260570915) versions.
Supplementary in-class lecture material from external sources will also be presented. Course
engagement, including with the interactive toolkit offered to you, is key to your success in this
course.
COURSE DESCRIPTION
The primary objective of Marketing 337 will be to introduce you to the basic concepts, practices
and tools of marketing. The course has a broad scope, is contemporary in outlook, and managerial
in orientation. Regardless of the field you ultimately choose to pursue, this course should give you
a strong grounding in the marketing discipline.
For marketing majors, you will find that this course provides a strong foundation for your future
studies and work opportunities. As we will quickly learn in class, however, “marketing” is not just
for marketing majors. It is not simply a function or a department. Instead, marketing is a process
1

which allows an organization to create and deliver value for customers – hopefully more value
than competitors offer – and therefore provides the engine for organic growth of an organization.
No matter what field you study in college and what career you eventually pursue, your success in
business will be largely determined by your ability to deliver more value to customers than your
competitors.
More specifically, in this class you will have the opportunity to…:
1. …understand that “marketing” is the discipline that drives how organizations can achieve
superior organic growth
2. …explain and apply the marketing process (i.e., developing promising configurations of
insights, strategies, and execution) that gears the organization for growth
3. …analyze and apply the marketing mix instruments (i.e., key tools and concepts pertaining to
product management, price management, communication management, and sales management)
COURSE OBJECTIVES
This course is designed to introduce business students to the principles of marketing as they relate
to the whole business enterprise. This course will be focusing on the understanding and application
of key marketing concepts. Memorization of the material in the text will not be sufficient.
Attendance in lectures and the participation in discussions during class will cement the concepts,
allow you to apply them to real business problems, and prepare you for the exams.
I will provide insight into the way in which customer wants and needs are transformed into a firm’s
strategies and tactics. This course will consist of class lectures, textbook, speakers, films, articles,
and cases all designed to give you a comprehensive understanding of marketing.
1. To provide you with knowledge of the history of marketing activities and the evolution of the
modern marketing system.
2. To heighten your awareness of the interaction between business and society as it relates to
marketing activities.
3. To expand your understanding of the marketing system and basic marketing vocabulary.
4. To develop your understanding of basic marketing activities and ways that marketing relates
to other business activities.
5. To sharpen your analysis of business strategy and tactics from a marketing person’s perspective.
6. To provide you with a framework for developing marketing strategy and a working
understanding of tools and tactics useful in implementing marketing strategy.
NATURE OF THE COURSE
I will personalize the class with outside information, guest speakers, films, and personal business
experiences. In addition to this material, the course will include discussions of articles on “current
events” related to marketing. You will be responsible for all speakers, films, and personal business
examples covered in each class.
Several guest lecturers may be invited to class. They have special marketing expertise that will
enrich the course content. There may be questions on examinations or quizzes from material that
is presented by the guest lecturers.
2

As much as possible I will try to involve you in all the course material by asking for your opinions
and comments on topics as they are covered in class. Please feel free to ask questions in class in
order to enhance your learning and understanding of marketing concepts. As we cover different
aspects of marketing, you will probably notice examples of marketing in the world around you.
I encourage you to keep up with current events in business and marketing by regularly
reading the popular business press, such as Business Week, Financial Times, USA Today (money
section), Fortune, Forbes, and The Wall Street Journal.
Business Week, USA Today, and Forbes are free to access the majority of content. Fortune is
behind a paywall. University of Texas students can access The Wall Street Journal online and
Financial Times online for free (though the Financial Times articles are delayed 30 days for
students) by following the link below:
https://guides.lib.utexas.edu/market/CNews
We will cover a great deal of information throughout the semester. In addition, each new topic in
the course builds on previously covered material. It is essential that you remain current in your
assignments, reading the appropriate text chapters prior to the class in which the relevant material
will be covered. This will both enhance your understanding of the lecture material and enable you
to comment and contribute in class.
The class lecture will consist of PPT slides covering material in the textbook, PPT slides from
outside sources, videos, articles, guest speakers, personal marketing experiences, and current
examples of marketing practices. You will be responsible for all material covered in class,
including PPT slides not included in the Canvas postings.
I would like to learn more about each of you personally. Please, feel free to take the time to “visit”
me or your TA during virtual office hours.
COVID Caveats: Students are strongly encouraged to wear a mask during class and while
indoors. Students are also strongly encouraged to get vaccinated if they can. Vaccinations are
available for free on campus. More information can be found here. To help keep everyone at UT
and in our community safe, it is critical that students report COVID-19 symptoms and testing,
regardless of test results, to University Health Services. Please see this link to understand what
needs to be reported. In addition, to help understand what to do if a fellow student in the class
(or the instructor or TA) tests positive for COVID, see this University Health Services link. We
strongly suggest you keep up with the University’s COVID-19 updates on its home page.
CLASS POLICIES AND EXPECTATIONS
Class sessions will include lecture, discussion, test, and other activities. The class sessions will be
based on content from the textbook, assigned readings, guest speakers, and videos. The keys to
having a successful experience in this class include:
1. Commit yourself to learn the concepts presented in this class. Don’t simply memorize
3

vocabulary words.
2. Be present at every class. At least ¼ of the questions on all exams will be based on lectures,
other in-class activities, and the ensuing discussions that take place in class.
3. Stay current with Canvas. Look at Canvas announcements for weekly updates, import
class notices, and grades. It is your responsibility to check Canvas regularly.
4. Take notes during class on all material, including the videos and speakers.
5. Please turn off your cell phone ringtone during class.
6. Participate in class discussion and ask questions, particularly with guest lecturers.
7. The material in this class builds on itself. Do not get behind. Read assigned chapters and
articles prior to the class in which they will be discussed. This will provide you with an
overview of the concepts and vocabulary so that our class lecture discussion will be much
more meaningful.
8. Observe the marketing principles we discuss in class you journey through your daily life:
 Read articles in the business press (e.g. Wall Street Journal, Business Week, etc.)
and think about the marketing implications for you, other consumers, the
organizations, the industry, the economy, and society.
 Think about the reasons why you buy a certain brand of clothes, beverages, or cars.
 Consider why products you buy are priced the way they are.
 Observe how many forms of advertising you encounter every day.
 Consider how diverse consumers can be and the effect this has on marketing
strategy.
 Reverse engineer the marketing efforts you are exposed to and understanding how
these efforts utilize (or don’t utilize) the marketing principles we discuss in this
class.
9. Conduct yourselves professionally. This includes “arriving” to class on time, turning off
your cell phones, listening quietly during lecture unless you have a question, refraining
from personal conversations during class, remaining focused on the material presented
instead of distractions, and being respectful of your classmates, guest speakers, the TA
and your instructor.
In general, students are expected to conduct themselves in accordance with the University
of Texas Code of Conduct and the Honor Code. You can review the Code of Conduct and
the Honor Code here.
Students who engage in unprofessional conduct or conduct against the University of Texas
Code of Conduct may be subject to disciplinary action, including but not limited to
temporary removal from the classroom setting.
10. I have no tolerance for acts of academic dishonesty. Such acts damage the reputation of
the University of Texas and the degree and demean the honest efforts of the majority of
students. The minimum penalty for act of academic dishonesty will be a zero for that
assignment or exam.

GRADING
Your grade in the course will be determined on the basis of three examinations. Each exam will
include 40 multiple-choice questions counting 2.5 points each. The questions will cover all the
material covered in the TEXTBOOK (TEXT AND GRAPHS), CLASS LECTURES, CLASS
SPEAKERS, FILMS, ARTICLES AND CASES DISCUSSED IN CLASS. You are
responsible for everything covered in the previously stated areas. There will be no curves
given on the exams; however, if questions are judged to be worthy of consideration an adjustment
may be given, to ensure fairness.
All exams will be available for review for ONLY one week following the posted grades. After
the one-week period, the exams are no longer available for review.
(Because of the size of the class, we cannot extend this beyond the stated time frame).
Final grades will be assigned based on your semester average as follows:
Semester Grade
Average Grade Points
93-100 A 4.00
90-92.99 A- 3.67
87-89.99 B+ 3.33
83-86.99 B 3.00
80-82.99 B- 2.67
77-79.99 C+ 2.33
73-76.99 C 2.00
70-72.99 C- 1.67
67-69.99 D+ 1.33
63-66.99 D 1.00
60-62.99 D- 0.67
59 or less F 0.00
Decimals will not be rounded up. (e.g. 89.7 average will be considered a “B+”, not an “A-”). THIS
CLASS IS NOT PASS/FAIL. YOUR GRADES WILL BE RECORDED.
VERY IMPORTANT!!!…In calculating your final course grade, you must use the below stated
“grading formula/percentages” – NOT CANVAS!!! CANVAS IS ‘NOT’ AN ACCURATE
WAY TO DETERMINE YOUR OVERALL COURSE GRADE, ONLY THE BELOW
STATED GRADING FORMULA/ PERCENTAGES IS CORRECT. If you have any
questions, please contact me or your class TA.
To be fair to all students, grade changes or additional extra credit opportunities will not be
considered. There will be no exceptions. No arguments about +s or –s because this would
remove the benefits of the +/- system, which was introduced to insure a more accurate
5

grading system. The way to get the grade that you want is by EARNING it during the
semester.
CLASS EXAMS, ASSIGNMENTS, & PROJECTS
Examinations (60% of Final Grade)
There will be three exams, each comprising 20% of your course grade. The exams will be
multiple-choice. Exams will cover assigned chapters in the textbook, other assigned readings,
lectures, class exercises, class discussions, videos, and guest speakers. You are responsible for
everything covered in the previously stated areas. The emphasis on these exams will be on the
application of concepts. Understanding of text material and knowledge of definitions are
expected since they may be test material.
The exams will be conducted in person in the classroom. And attendance will be taken
during the exam. Anyone who takes the exam outside the classroom will NOT get credit for
the exams. I will refer any suspected violations of academic dishonestly to the Office of the
Dean of Students for investigation. An ‘F’ in the course will be the recommended penalty in
most cases of exam cheating or other scholastic dishonesty.
Each exam will ONLY be provided during the regular class period on the dates specified above
at the start of our regular class time of 8:00 AM. Please consult the calendar and establish that
the exam dates/times will not conflict with your schedule during the first day of class. You must
take the exam on the date and time indicated above and in the class calendar.
No alternative test dates or times will be provided except as required for those students
presenting a letter of accommodation from the Dean of Students SSD office, students observing
religious holy days, and students dealing with health emergencies. No make-up dates are
offered for students who miss an exam. Remember that if you miss an exam, you will be given
a zero.
Team Marketing Research Project (20% of Final Grade)
The purpose of the Team Project is to create a marketing strategy for a business. Outstanding
projects demonstrate application of principles of personal selling techniques learned throughout
the course, and focus on a forward-looking marketing plan, not an analysis of the company’s
existing marketing plan. Points will be deducted for missing any of the “required” components
outlined in the project description.
Each student will be assigned to a team and a due date at the beginning of the semester. That
team is responsible for a 10 to 12-page double-spaced with 1’ margins, Times New Roman, (not
including exhibits or references) marketing strategy plan. Papers may be analyzed for plagiarism
through software such as Turnitin. A handout with specific guidelines will be posted later in the
semester. The team will also have to present the content of the plan in a 10-minute presentation,
followed by 5 minutes of Q&A. Exceeding this limit will result in a lowered class presentation
grade.
Your paper will represent 70% of your project grade and the presentation will be 30% of your
project grade.
6

Each team member is expected to pull his or her weight. Freeloaders will not be tolerated. Any
reported lack of commitment or contribution to the team effort will be reflected anywhere from a
lowered individual grade up to complete removal from the team. You will evaluate your team
members’ participation periodically throughout the semester.
Quizzes (5% of Final Grade)
You will take two unannounced quizzes during class, each consisting of ten true-false questions
on Canvas covering the assigned reading for the day. We will provide the code to access the
timed quiz during class. We recommend taking the quiz on your phone or laptop as we will only
have a limited number of paper copies available. Each quiz is worth 2.5% of your Final Grade.
Article Summaries (10% of Final Grade)
Students will be asked to write and turn in two thoughtful article summaries on articles provided
to them via Canvas. These articles will be discussed in class as a part of the subject being
lectured on that day. Article summaries should be between 1.5-2 pages double-spaced in Times
New Roman font size 12 with 1” margins.
Articles, the write up deadlines, and information on how to write an article summary will be
posted to Canvas. The write ups will be due by the start of class (8:00 am) on the day it is due.
Please submit via Canvas. Late article summaries may be unaccepted.
Class Attendance and Participation (5% of Final Grade)
Students are expected to attend class on a regular basis and on time. Attendance will be taken
periodically through formats such as the quizzes, sign-in sheets, and others. Class participation
opportunities will occur throughout the semester, including discussion about current events,
articles summaries, and Q&A sessions with guest speakers.
Participation in class means insights that you share during class, that serve to add value to the
ongoing discussion. Quality is preferred over quantity as you will not be graded on “air time”.
The quality of your participation will be gauged by perceived preparation, participation in
discussions, ability to answer posed questions and your ability to connect the material being
discussed with course readings from your text or from cases. Your comments should be designed
to raise the overall understanding of the course material for the entire class.
Due to the size of the class, your participation grade will be based on a combination of in-class
verbal participation and online participation. Your grade will be based on the quality of your
participation during class. There are two ways to participate in class - either contribute verbally
during class discussion or contribute to the Canvas discussion boards. This will give you the
opportunity to participate in the discussion even if you are unable to participate during class
time. An "A" student ideally meaningfully participates in either of the two ways about once a
week.
Religious Holy Days & Health Emergencies: If you must miss a class, a work assignment, or a
project in order to observe a religious holiday, please email me by the 4th class day so that
7

alternative arrangements can be made. I will give you an opportunity to complete the missed
work within a reasonable time after the absence.
Students with special circumstances (non-ADA) that require you to miss class, including
for COVID-19 symptoms, should complete the absence notification request form with Student
Emergency Services.
Personal Branding Project (Extra Credit Opportunity)
You will have the opportunity to develop a personal branding project in order to better market
yourself and distinguish yourself (from the competition). Strong branding strategies have shown
to outperform less recognized ones by 73%. Building a solid personal brand makes you more
visible to recruiters during campus interviews and leaves a lasting impression.
You have two options for your personal branding project. Further instructions, templates, and
samples will be provided on Canvas. You may select one of the following projects:
1. Personal Branding Brochure. You will create an informative personal branding brochure
with good organization. Examples are available in the Canvas files.
2. Personal website. You will create a personal website using your choice of free website
building software.
2 points will be added to your “lowest exam grade” for completing one of these options.
Marketing Department Research Studies (Extra Credit Opportunity)
You will have an opportunity to earn extra credit by participating in research studies run by the
Marketing Department. Paige Abbott, the Behavioral Research Lab Coordinator, will reach out
to you in the first few weeks of the semester to set up your research hub login information.
Please contact Paige at paige.abbott@mccombs.utexas.edu if you are having trouble getting your
login information.
2 points per completed study will be added to your “lowest exam grade” for a possible total
of 4 points.

MEETING YOUR GRADE GOALS
First, review this syllabus and the course requirements carefully. There are many opportunities
provided to help you succeed in this course. However, you must take advantage of them
throughout the semester. Please note that grades are based on your inputs, not your effort, nor
your improvement. I expect each of you to have the time management skills to evaluate course
requirements, complete them on time, and accept the consequences of your choices.
Please see the instructor or TA for guidance early in the semester if you are not meeting your
grade goals. Your TA will not provide notes for missed classes! A buddy system where a fellow
student can take notes for you and you for them due to an absence is a smart idea.
It is always disappointing to hear from students at the end of the semester who did not take
advantage of the available resources during the semester and are a point away from a higher
grade. Do not be the one of them! All choices – even ‘right’ ones – have consequences, so
skipping class/studying less to meet other legitimate life needs will not excuse you from
receiving the grade you earn in this class. The instructor will not discuss or consider any grade
changes at the end of the semester (regardless of special circumstances, improvement, good
intentions, needs, desires, etc.) so please put your effort into this class throughout the semester
and accept the consequences of your choices.
STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES
Students with disabilities may request appropriate academic accommodations from the Division
of Diversity and Community Engagement, Services for Students with Disabilities, 471-6259.
Your letter should be brought to the attention of the TA at the beginning of the semester to
arrange accommodations. This must be submitted within two weeks of the start of the semester.
TA: Your TA should be contacted on all grade, review, test, speaker, article, textbook, and
absence issues, etc. Feel free to copy me on all email correspondence. Your TA will NOT
provide notes for missed classes! Students who use TA office hours regularly to ask questions
about course material or simply to ask directions regarding study methods tend to do better in
class.
ACADEMIC DISHONESTY
The McCombs School of Business has no tolerance for acts of scholastic dishonesty. The
Marketing 337 class will operate in full compliance with the Policy Statement on Scholastic
Dishonesty for the College of Business Administration, which is described in detail here. By
9

enrolling in this class, you have agreed to observe all student responsibilities described in that
document. If the application of that Policy Statement to this class and its assignments is unclear
in any way, it is your responsibility to ask me for clarification.
Students who violate University rules on scholastic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary
penalties, including the possibility of failure in the course and /or dismissal from the University.
You should refer to the General Information Catalog to access the official University Policies
and procedures on scholastic dishonesty.
All assignments in this course may be processed by TurnItIn, a tool that compares submitted
material to an archived database of published work to check for potential plagiarism. Other
methods may also be used to determine if a paper is the student's original work. Regardless of
the results of any TurnItIn submission, the faculty member will make the final determination as
to whether or not a paper has been plagiarized.
FINAL THOUGHTS
Please take advantage of the opportunities in this course. I am here to help you learn as much as
possible about marketing strategies and concepts. Please keep in mind that this is a dynamic
course that incorporates the growth and changes in the field of marketing. Marketing requires
you to integrate, to be imaginative, and to be decisive in situations with limited information.
Develop a mindset that allows you to think as a way of life. Remember, you will be able to use
the skills and knowledge you have learned in this class in whatever path you take in your career.
At the same time, I will give you valuable insight into the real world that will benefit you as you
pursue a career in an increasingly global marketplace.
Foremost, this course should be very enjoyable. You will get out of this class what YOU put
into it. If you will commit yourself to preparation, apply yourself to the tasks at hand, and then
open yourself up to learn and succeed. I think you will find this one of the most enjoyable
practical courses you will take in your college career. It will DEFINITELY help you get
Ahead in Life.
