Canvas: Lecture notes, recitation section notes, handouts, homework solutions, and grades will be
posted on Canvas.
Homework: Assigned approximately once per week. You may work together on the homework.
However, each student must hand in his or her own solution, and must contribute substantially to
the solution of any problem he or she hands in. Some homework assignments may require
numerical solutions, which you will need to provide using Excel, Mathematica, or some other
programming environment. Homework assignments will all be worth the same point value even
though their difficulty level and length will vary. Homework will be accepted one lecture late with a
penalty of 10%. No homework will be accepted after that, except as discussed below. Your lowest
homework grade will be dropped in the calculation of your final course grade.
If the workload on the grader is excessive due to the large enrollment of this course, we may need to
base homework grades on partial grading of assignments.
Recitation sessions: Recitation sessions will be scheduled on an as-needed basis. These will be used to
review material, do additional practice problems, and/or as homework help sessions. Attendance at
these sections is optional.
Tests: There will be three in-class tests. Your lowest test score will be dropped in the calculation of the
final grade.
Final: There will be a comprehensive final exam during the scheduled exam time for this class.
Make-up tests and homework: You may not skip tests or hand in late homework without [(i) a
legitimate reason (illness, family emergency, etc.) (ii) appropriate documentation (e.g. doctor’s
note), and (iii) advance permission from me, if it is reasonably possible for you to make such a
request] OR [because of observance of a religious holy day (see below)]. If you satisfy all three of
requirements (i)-(iii) or the religious exception, you will be allowed to turn in the homework late, or
take a make-up test. Otherwise your score for that homework or test will be zero.

Course grade: Homework 24%, Highest two test scores 20% each, and Final Exam 36%. Course
grades will be determined strictly from your calculated weighted average score using the above
weight factors. If differences between the average scores of tests are large, I may scale the scores to
make their averages more similar. I do not use fixed grade breakpoints. I will provide some
guidance during the semester of approximate grade breakpoints. You will not be able to earn a
grade based only on your Final Exam score.
Disabilities: Students with disabilities may request appropriate academic accommodations from the
Division of Diversity and Community Engagement, Services for Students with Disabilities, 512-
471-6259, http://www.utexas.edu/diversity/ddce/ssd/
Religious observance: Students are entitled to a make-up exam or to turn in late work if this is
needed for observance of a religious holy day. Students who want to exercise this right must
inform me of the observance 14 days in advance.
University Honor Code: The core values of the University of Texas at Austin are learning,
discovery, freedom, leadership, individual opportunity, and responsibility. Each member of the
University is expected to uphold these values through integrity, honesty, trust, fairness, and
respect toward peers and community.
