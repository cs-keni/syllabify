There are 2 closed book midterm tests and a closed book final exam. All will be a
combination of very short essay questions and questions of an analytical sort designed
to test your understanding of the material covered.
Midterm test 1 (part A): 40
Midterm test 1 (part B): 60

Final exam: 100
----
300
No late exams will be administered without a documented reason (e.g., a doctor’s
note or a funeral slip). Please contact Dr. Tye BEFORE the relevant test or exam
to make alternative arrangements.
The University of Texas at Austin provides, upon request, appropriate academic
accommodations for qualified students with disabilities. For more information,
contact the Office of the Dean of Students at 471-6259 or 471-4641 TTY.
CLASS EXPECTATIONS
1. Attendance is mandatory and will be taken in both lecture and discussion
sections. Students who show a pattern of missing class either for lectures or
1

discussion sections will be demoted one grade below that earned on the tests
and final exam.
2. Students are expected to keep abreast of readings from all textbooks. In-class
questions and class discussion are encouraged.
3. Students MUST have an updated e-mail address in UTDirect. Class
announcements will be made on the web at blackboard (go to
courses.utexas.edu and follow the log-in instructions).
4. Prior to each class, the powerpoint slides for the upcoming class will be made
available on the web at ut canvas (under files for this course) with some key
words missing. It is your responsibility to come to class with print-outs of
these slides so that you can fill in the missing words during the class
lectures. The lecture pace will be too fast for you to write down the entire
contents of the slides in the event that you do not bring copies of them
with you.
5. Experts advise that students spend 2-3 hours studying out-of-class, per hour
in-class time, to earn a passing grade. This means that students should
spend an additional 5-7 hours studying philosophy of mind EACH week of
class (not including the time spent in class).
GRADING: A total of 300 points may be accrued through the whole course.
Attendance and class participation may contribute to raising the grades of students
within a few points of the cutoff (but this is not guaranteed). Individual letter grades per
test or exam will NOT be recorded, only points earned are recorded.
ALL REQUIREMENTS MUST BE MET TO RECEIVE A FINAL GRADE. This includes
students taking the course on a pass/fail basis.
Points needed for Final Grades
A 278-300; A- 270-277
B+ 263-269; B 247-262; B- 240-246

COURSE CONTENT
This course examines the relationship of the mind to the body. Topics covered
include whether a machine could think, the Turing Test for intelligence, whether fish
have feelings, the reduction of the mind to the brain, whether consciousness can be
captured materialistically, and the nature of persons and personal identity.
We'll be thinking about immaterial spirits, futuristic computers and robots, simple
animals, Martians who behave like us but who have an internal structure very
different from ours, brains in vats…. We will consider whether these strange
characters have thoughts and feelings. The point is not to consider bizarre cases
just for the sake of it, but to see what light we can shed on our own nature as beings
with mental lives.
