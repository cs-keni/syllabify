Overview and Objectives
Welcome to Scientific and Technical Writing! This course offers practice in a range of common
genres of writing in scientific and technical career fields. Though writing is driven by a number of
different rhetorical occasions in these fields, there are foundational skills identifiable and graspable
in each. You will be asked to consider the real possible writing contexts for your planned career, and
you’ll work closely with your classmates to practice the kind of group collaboration that will be
expected of you in your professional life. For the purposes of providing students with opportunities
to try their hands at different sorts of professional writing, this course is assignment intensive. Since
we’re considering topics to which these different writing genres are suited, the course also involves
rigorous research. It’s my hope that, by the end of this course, you will have an arsenal of familiar
forms of professional writing as well as the research skillset to familiarize yourself with any kind of
scientific or professional writing conventions.
Learning Objectives
By completing WR 320, you will increase your confidence in the following:
1. Creating documents that are relevant to the purpose and context in which they are written and
appropriate for the audience to which they are addressed.
2. Creating documents that proceed logically and connect ideas effectively, according to genre,
purpose and context.
3. Producing written work that displays adherence to the conventions of its context (academic or
professional), including control of grammar, spelling, word usage, syntax, and punctuation; use of
appropriate tone, style, and diction; uses appropriate formatting, media, design, and documentation
of sources.
4. Effectively revising the content and organization of messages both by reevaluating the reasoning
and context of the message and responding to critiques from peers and instructors.

Career Readiness
An objective of this course is to provide you hands-on experience in communication skills you can
use in the future. Specifically, you will have opportunity to work on the follow career competencies
identified by the UO and the National Association of Colleges and Employers. You will work on:
Critical Thinking: Identify and respond to needs based upon an understanding of situational
context and logical analysis of relevant information.
Communication: Clearly and effectively exchange information, ideas, facts, and perspectives with
persons inside and outside of an organization.
Teamwork/Collaboration: Build and maintain collaborative relationships to work effectively
toward common goals, while appreciating diverse viewpoints and shared responsibilities.
Course Materials
You will not need to purchase any materials for this course. We will be using freely available Open
Education Resources, available on Canvas, including
• Technical Writing Essentials
• Open Oregon Technical Writing Textbook
• Online Technical Writing
• Craft of Research
All additional material you will read, watch, and listen to will be provided as links and/or pdf files in
the weekly overview and in the assigned readings module. Links and advice for how to engage with
course materials will be included in weekly overviews in each week’s module.
Course Learning Methods: Compassion, Curiosity, Commitment
Success in WR 320 will depend more on your openness to and curiosity than on your previous
academic experience or existing knowledge about the topics we will explore together.
Your grade will be determined by the labor you put in and your own engagement with course material,
activities, the writing of your peers, and the course learning goals.
I ask that you:
• Be a compassionate member of our class community — challenge yourself to take risks
and support your classmates as they take risks.
• Be curious and open to new methods, ideas, and perspectives. You’ll do this by deeply
and respectfully reading and responding to assigned articles and the work of your
classmates. Sometimes this material will require watching and/or listening.
• Be willing to write, read, and respond to the best of your ability.
I commit to:
• Checking your understanding of key concepts about literacy.
• Deeply and respectfully reading your work and taking your ideas seriously.

• Challenging you to go further and take risks by giving feedback, asking questions, and
providing additional material.
Together we will repeat this process until you feel more confident drawing on and responding to
different writing situations and imagining how you could apply the scientific and technical writing
skills you are building in the future.

Late Work Policy
• An automatic 48-hour extension is available for all assigned work.
• You do not need to contact me within the 48-hour period.
• After 48 hours, I can no longer accept your work without hearing from you. It will be
considered unsubmitted and incomplete unless we come to an agreement.
Please make every effort to submit group discussion posts on time so your classmates have adequate
time to respond.
Shared Responsibilities and Extenuating Circumstances
I will do my best to be clear about assignment expectations and how I will assess your work. It’s
your responsibility to contact me when you are confused, overwhelmed, or unsure about
class expectations. Talk to me before an assignment is due, not after, if possible.
That way I can help you talk through your confusion, brainstorm ideas, consider possibilities, give
you resources, and discuss your work with you—that’s an integral part of my role in our class! I can’t
make exceptions or extend grading deadlines unless you talk to me before the assignment is due.
I am only able to help you be successful in the course if we are in communication!
Use of GenAI application (e.g., ChatGPT)
Students may not use GenAI tools in this course to produce course materials or assignments in
whole or in part. All work you submit for this course toward completion of course requirements
must be your own original work done specifically for this course and without substantive assistance
from others, including GenAI. Work you’ve completed for previous courses or are developing for
other courses this term also should not be submitted for this course. In accordance with UO policy,
if I believe you’ve handed in work created all or in part by GenAI, I will submit a report of
suspected academic misconduct to the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards for
that office to make a determination of responsibility and, if warranted, assess a grade penalty. If you
have any questions or doubts, please ask!
