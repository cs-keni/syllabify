Course Objectives
This is a required class for marketing students in the McCombs undergraduate business program.
The course is designed for students who want to pursue a career in marketing, but can also be taken
also by other students interested in marketing research.
The aim of the course is to teach students the methods, principles, and theories of modern marketing
research and to apply these to practical business settings. Students will learn the concepts and
terminology used by marketers, marketing researchers, and master methodological tools to obtain a
competitive advantage in the business world.
Prerequisites: Admission to a Business major or credits for MKT 337 and STA 309.
The specific learning objectives of the course are to:
1. Understand how data can be analyzed to develop information and insights
2. Learn how to set up a research design
3. Learn how to select appropriate research and analysis for a given problem and data type

Information and Analysis – Fall 2023 – Professor Annabelle Roberts
4. Apply methods of data collection and analysis to solve real marketing problems
5. Improve business writing and presentation skills
6. Gain more experience working in teams
Quantitative Reasoning
This course carries the Quantitative Reasoning flag. Quantitative Reasoning courses are designed to
equip you with skills that are necessary for understanding the types of quantitative arguments you
will regularly encounter in your adult and professional life. You should therefore expect a
substantial portion of your grade to come from your use of quantitative skills to analyze real-world
problems.
Course Materials
There is no required textbook for this class. All relevant materials to enable and fulfill learning
objectives for the course will be shared on the Canvas course page, through lecture slides and other
publicly available reference materials.
Course Assessment
1. Attendance and Participation 10%
2. Assignments 25%
3. Quizzes (in-class) 20%
4. Midterm Exam 20%
5. Project 25%
1. Attendance and Participation: You are expected to prepare for, attend, and participate in
class. All classes will be held in-person, unless otherwise noted. Attendance will be taken
either at the beginning or end of the class per the instructor’s discretion. You will receive
two free passes for absences. This will constitute 5% of the course grade. The other 5% of the
grade will come from active participation in class activities and discussion.
2. Assignments: The only way to really learn the material covered in class is through a “do-it-
yourself” approach. I will provide you with the appropriate datasets and you will be required
to apply the tools learned in the class to analyze and understand a real business scenario.
You may turn in homework late. Each day that the homework is late will result in a 10%
penalty. You are allowed to discuss concepts with classmates but these are meant to be
individual assignments. Therefore, please do not share your answers or write-ups. You must
write and submit your answers individually. I highly encourage you to try to do as much of
the assignment yourself as you can and come to office hours with specific, prepared
questions.
3. Quizzes: Five quizzes through Canvas made available during class time will serve as
concept checks and must be completed individually without group discussion. There will be

Information and Analysis – Fall 2023 – Professor Annabelle Roberts
no make-up quizzes after the scheduled time. However, the lowest quiz grade will be
dropped. If you cannot take the quiz during the designated class time, please email me and
the TA ahead of time so I can give you permission to take the quiz before the rest of the
class takes it.
4. Midterm: There will be one midterm during class time, which will cover the first half of the
course. Please do not miss the exam. Makeup exams are allowed only for extreme
emergencies. Recruiting related conflicts do not constitute emergencies. You should
schedule interviews so they do not conflict with the exam.
5. Group Project: This project asks you to apply the tools you learned in this class to a real
business situation. You will work in teams to identify a market research question for a
business, collect data and information related to the problem, perform data analysis, and
come up with recommendations. Your team will submit a project proposal and a report for
the project (with a maximum of 15 pages not including appendices) and make a 15 minute
presentation in the class about your problem and findings. Please discuss with me or the TA
about your proposed project. Peer evaluations will be an important part in determining the
individual grade to avoid “free rides.”
Evaluation of Student Work
The final letter grades in the course will be based on a curve that will be approximately as below. A
grade of X (incomplete) is very uncommon and will be given only for very unusual circumstances
determined to be appropriate by the professor. You must notify the professor as soon as a problem
occurs and may be required to provide sufficient evidence.
94-100 A 77-79 C+
90-93 A- 74-76 C
87-89 B+ 70-73 C-
84-86 B 67-69 D+
80-83 B- Below 60 = F
General Notes
• This syllabus is subject to change. I will announce any changes in class and on Canvas.
While it is your responsibility to note these changes when announced, I will do my best to
ensure that you are notified of changes with as much advanced notice as possible.
• Each student is responsible for taking class notes and completing assigned work on time. It
is strongly suggested that you plan to attend every class during the semester. No special
considerations will be given for work/lectures missed due to unexcused absences.
• If you must miss a session due to illness or emergency, please let the professor and TA
know as soon as possible, preferably beforehand. In the interest of promoting collective
wellness, our goal is to make it easy to stay home if you don’t feel well.
• You are STRONGLY encouraged to see the professor and the TA at the first sign of any
problem or lack of understanding.

Information and Analysis – Fall 2023 – Professor Annabelle Roberts
• Course announcements, syllabus, assignments, handouts, supplemental readings, slides, and
grades are made available through Canvas. All students are required to regularly check the
Canvas page for announcements.
• All grades will be posted on Canvas. Once a grade is posted, students have up to one week
to identify potential grading errors with the professor. After one week has passed, the
original grade will become permanent.
• Please refer to the University and McCombs Resources for Students document on Canvas
for valuable information regarding how to get help in the event of an emergency, physical
health issues, mental health issues, issues involving other people, food and emergency

Policy on Scholastic Dishonesty
The McCombs School of Business has no tolerance for acts of scholastic dishonesty.
The responsibilities of both students and faculty with regard to scholastic dishonesty are described
in detail in the BBA Program’s Statement on Scholastic Dishonesty at
http://my.mccombs.utexas.edu/BBA/Code-of-Ethics. By teaching this course, I have agreed to
observe all faculty responsibilities described there. By enrolling in this class, you have agreed to
observe all student responsibilities described there. If the application of the Statement on
Scholastic Dishonesty to this class or its assignments is unclear in any way, it is your responsibility
to ask me for clarification. Students who violate University rules on scholastic dishonesty are
subject to disciplinary penalties, including the possibility of failure in the course and/or dismissal
from the University. Since dishonesty harms the individual, all students, the integrity of the
University, and the value of our academic brand, policies on scholastic dishonesty will be strictly
enforced. You should refer to the Student Conduct and Academic Integrity website at
http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/conduct/ to access the official University policies and procedures
on scholastic dishonesty as well as further elaboration on what constitutes scholastic dishonesty.

Unauthorized sharing of materials promotes cheating. It is a violation of the University’s Student
Honor Code and an act of academic dishonesty, which can result in sanctions.
