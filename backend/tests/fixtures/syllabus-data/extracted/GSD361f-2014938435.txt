Description
This class will combine perspectives from philosophy and the history of philosophy to
undertake a project in "historical epistemology": it will trace how Logical Positivism/Empiricism, the
precursor to analytic philosophy, actually came into being out of methodological arguments
widespread in the late nineteenth century (and which find their echoes in figures as diverse as
Nietzsche and Heidegger, Wittgenstein, Neurath and Carnap).
This observation will guide a second strand to the class: how the analytic/continental
philosophy divide that is present in all the reference books and textbooks came into being, what it
leaves out, and how to figure out what is left out. In today's dominant account, Anglo-American
Analytic Philosophy grows out of the tradition of Logical Positivism/Logical Empiricism as it evolved in
the circles around Wittgenstein in England after the Second World War, and it positions itself over and
against Continental Philosophy.
That story, however, is strategic as much as it is true. It depends on how a group of
philosophers dealt with forced migration and emigration -- victims of Nazi aggression driven out of
continental Europe and to the US and Great Britain. And in order to find their feet, these émigrés took
up new projects and redefined their work for new audiences, offering a set of cases of culture transfer -
- cases where philosophical logics responded directly, if tacitly, to politics and culture. This origin story
does not figure into today's dominant accounts of the history of philosophy, and this class will offer
some explanations as to how philosophy defined itself in the latter 20th century by ignoring it.
No background in philosophy is required for this course, and all readings are available in
English on the class blackboard site. Background reading on the history of science will ground our
readings of primary texts, and each student will be responsible for evolving a semester project in
writing a specific philosopher or project into a new kind of intercultural history of ideas.
Class Objectives:
By the end of this class, you will be able to:
• Explain how a "canon" of "important texts" is a construct that needs to be questioned, and how to do that
• Learn to read, compare, and evaluate unfamiliar philosophical texts
• Evaluate and write about popular and scholarly explanations of key philosophers/philosophical texts
• Structure and write an essay comparing two texts systematically
• Plan and execute the research and writing of a professionally formatted, scholarly paper (in short format)
using philosophical texts
Class Readings will Include (all in excerpts):
Ludwig Wittgenstein, The Blue and Brown Books
Nietzsche, On the Genealogy of Morals
Windelband, History of Philosophy
Rickert, The Limits of Concept Formation in Natural Science
Wilhelm Dilthey, The Formation of the Historical World in the Human Sciences
Husserl, The Idea of Phenomenology
Cassirer, The Logic of the Cultural Sciences
Benjamin, Exposés from The Arcades Project
Viktor Kraft, The Vienna Circle
Janik/Toulmin, Wittgenstein's Vienna
Friedrich Stadler, The Vienna Circle
Feyerabend, Against Method
Essays by Carnap, Neurath

ASSIGNMENTS:
• Three one-page précis (analysis of individual texts) = 3 x 10% of grade =30% of grade.
Instructions appended.
• Group project (on materials for Part 4 of syllabus) = 10 % of grade
Janik/Toulmin, Wittgenstein's Vienna (intellectual history, situating ideas)
Waugh, The House of Wittgenstein (political biography)
Edmonds and Eidinow, Wittgenstein's Poker (group bio & intellectual history)
Monk, Wittgenstein: The Duty of Genius (biography and work)
This is a group project using a wiki page off the Class Canvas site. The class will break into four groups,
each of which is responsible for presenting one of the four books on Wittgenstein listed above.
That presentation will be a critical book review that does a resume´ of the book's contents (in no
more than 500 words, total), and then assesses its point of view and effectiveness. The book
groups should divvy up the chapters for commentary, with each individual writing the summary of
separate parts (with necessary quotations and citations, and the author of each subsection); a
group meeting will probably be necessary to finish the task -- the introduction and conclusion of the
presentation, which should be joint work. October 14 class is devoted to some of this
organizational time.
The project will be graded liberally to account for the dynamics of group work. Any project with a readable
account of the contents and nan assessment of its point of view and possible effectiveness for its
readership will get full credit; missing pieces, unintelligible work, plagiarized work, vague or
incomplete work will lose points.
• Short Essay: Historical epistemology project = 25% of grade
This project is a short (5-6-page) paper done according to the format below, and addressing one of
the following two topics:
Topic 1: Hahn, Neurath, Carnap. "The Scientific Conception of the World" (AKA the "Vienna Circle
manifesto") compared with Galison, "Constructing Modernism." The goal of this
comparison is to assess the "Vienna Circle Manifesto" from the optic offered by Galison,
who makes the case for the meaning of Aufbau/Construction from the essay's title in
historical context. Is Galison's work useful to understanding the Manifesto?
Topic 2: Wittgenstein, "Thinking," in Wittgenstein Reader, 111-125, compared with Heidegger,
"What Calls for Thinking?," in Basic Writings, 341-367. The goal of this comparison is a
technical comparison of what "thinking" means in the two essays. What does the use of
the term tell us about each thinker?
The paper you will write is an essay: a well-constructed argument about two texts, with little or no
research involved. Thus you need to start with a clear thesis statement and
introductory paragraph (indicating the overall direction of your argument and how you will
argue it), in proper format. Be sure you do more than summarize your points at the end -
- make sure you conclude about where your argument takes you.
FORMAT
• Double spaced, 1 inch margins all round.
• 11 or 12-point type, Arial, Geneva, Times or Times New Roman
• Your name and a page number on EVERY PAGE (top right or bottom center or right --
use "header" or "footer"). Pages must be stapled together.
• All citations (footnotes or endnotes, and bibliography) must be in Chicago Style. Is this a
mystery? See < http://www.lib.utexas.edu/students/citing/index.html > for general
information or < http://www.lib.utexas.edu/noodlebib/ > to use Noodlebib. That means
you have some decisions about the relation of notes to in-text citations and to the
bibliography.

• One semester project, done in stages = 35% of grade.
This project is a formal research paper (12-15 pp. in length, in Chicago style) on a topic of your
choice related to the Vienna Circle and its context. Due at the official exam time, as
indicated on the syllabus. The work will be done in phases:
1) consultation with professor on topic (in person or by email) = 5% of grade
2) bibliography of 6-10 items on the topic, with a description of how you found the items (i.e.
what professional databases you used in searching them out. No more than 2 of the
items may be on-line- only or reference sources (e.g. Stanford Encyclopedia of
Philosophy); you are expected to use legitimate secondary literature (principally articles
in professional journals) = 10 % of grade
3) Finished paper = 20% of grade (further grading rubric to be distributed)

Introduction to the Précis
There is a difference between a text's facts and the strategy used to present those facts. A "précis" (`pray-
see) reflects this difference. It is designed to reflect the structure of an argument based on textual information and to
structure the presentation of data from the texts concerned in ways that support that argument. As such, it offers more
than just a set of notes on the text's contents or an argument; it represents the argument strategy, both verbally and
visually.
A précis is usually one typed page long. It starts by reflecting the logic of a text to be addressed (with "text"
being an object in any medium --film, novel, essay -- or a situation/performance). It ends with your assessment of the
effectiveness/appropriateness/correctness/usefulness of that logic, in a paragraph that argues that assessment with
specific reference to the précis' set-up and development. That is, the first sections of the précis are not intended to be
creative or original, but are rather focused on how to represent the text's argument logic by assembling facts drawn
from it, while the final sections must move beyond that assemblage into your own evaluation of how/why that argument
will or won't work.
No matter what type (analytic or synthetic [see below], a précis has four sections:
1) A statement about the FOCUS of the information you are assembling to represent the argument of a text or
situation. This initial statement describes the main issue that characterizes a text or situation (an analytic
précis) or presents the argument being made using the textual materials (a synthetic précis). This statement
will not focus on the plot or on text details, but rather it expresses the global "what is this arrangement of
material about? What will I read about, if it's about a text; what kind of argument is being structured, if it's
making a new case by combining the information in two texts or situations?"
• **You write a concise statement (1-2 sentences) that expresses that focus. Likely alternatives: issues
or problems, representative concerns of a group, or beliefs, institutions/systems, or events and their
characteristics or repercussions (E.G.: "This film takes up the case of X and shows why it's a problem
to Y or in context Z.")
What not to do: Do not include journalistic commentary, or examples, or evaluations.
2) A statement of the LOGIC according to which the text or argument organizes the information to be presented
(to anticipate section 3) and of the GOAL or INTENT of that presentation.
• **You write a sentence describing the logic pattern that will be used to establish and label the chart
below.. Typical verbs indicating such logic: compare, contrast, link causally, cause, follow from . .
. (E.g.: the author correlates x and y; the film represents x by showing y; by comparing male and
female roles . . . ).
• **You write an additional short sentence or clause describing why the information is set up that
way (its goal or intent). Typical cues: in order to, because that correlation will show . . . , in order
to convince X of Y, in order to argue X
3) A DATA CHART (OR MATRIX) WITH HEADINGS that organize text data in comprehensible patterns,
presented in two parallel columns of notes and comments.
The two columns correlate with each other, left to right, as the two terms in a logical statement
(standing in a distinct logic pattern: topic x and comment y about x. Examples of correlations might be "x
causes/effects/produces y," "x contrasts/compares with y," "x correlates with y in some way other than
compare/contrast" ["x is part of y in this way", "is restricted by", "is characterized by", "hopes to achieve",
"impacts," "x does y for the reasons stated above" etc.).' This correlation should reflect the logic statement
from the section above.
Each column has approximately three examples (one in each cell or box), often with words explicitly
drawn from the text (and with in-text bibliographic citations); each column contains information of the same
type. Each row contains one proposition.
*** You draw and label a chart with two headers, with at least three examples in each, and each
with a proper in-text citation (page reference, etc.),
HEADER X HEADER Y

4) A PARAGRAPH (ca. 3 sentences) indicating the ASSESSMENT OR IMPLICATIONS OF or CONCLUSIONS
ABOUT the information pattern. This is not a description of the information pattern or focus, but rather an
extension of the covert statement implied by the information and pattern. That is, what is this text/précis
good for, especially as seen from the outside? In setting the argument up this way, what is being hidden,
asserted, or brushed aside? What is new or old-fashioned about the correlations made? Who would profit
most by this arrangement? Why is this analysis Important?

ASSESSMENT / IMPLICATION: (one coherent paragraph) (box not needed)
GRADING: Each section (focus, logic, matrix, assessment) gets up to 3 points for execution, and an additional 3
points is given for consistency (do all the sections follow from and build on each other, as part of a developing
analysis?), for a total of 15 points for the assignment as a whole.
Grading Rubric for Each Section
0 = missing, vapid/general (with few or no specific references to a text or situation)
1= partially present, with some defects in execution or some missing or underdeveloped parts of the section
2 = all necessary parts of the section are present and adequately executed
3 = section well-developed and/or well-stated; section exceeds minimum requirements for precision and execution
CONVERSIONS: 15 points = A; 12 points = B; 9 points = C; 7 points and below = F
Analytic, Synthetic, and Interpretive Précis:
Three Different Arguments from (Text) Data
An analytic précis aims at recreating the focus, strategy/goal (intent), and information of one particular text.
You, as the analyst of the text, track the text's logical structure and message, intruding on it only during a final
evaluation (in the Assessment, after the Matrix). Your job is first to represent (in three sections) the claims made by a

particular text as the text itself argues (that is, by tracking its own logic structure and data-gathering strategies, not just
its message). After that, you have to assess the success or failures of that argument type and data corpus, especially
with respect to (outside) contexts in which those claims are valid, dangerous, useful, etc. Who would profit from this
argument, or be harmed by it, and thus would be interested in it?
A synthetic précis sets up a comparison/contrast between two (or more) texts. Its focus is the/an issue shared
by the two texts; its two columns of data must be strictly parallel, as necessarily reflects a compare/contrast logic.
However, it is up to you, the analyst, to specify (in the 2 parts of the logic statement) on which grounds and to what end
the comparison will be carried out. The information pattern will be drawn from two texts, often with one framed in each
column, with each row offering parallel points. The Assessment of this synthetic logic is again provided by you in the last
section of your précis, responding to "why do this comparison?"
An interpretive précis uses one text (or point of view or established argument) to read another. That is, you
take up the point of view of one text, and "read" the other as it would lead you to do. In the Assessment paragraph, you
step out of the chosen POV or role-play, and evaluate what the lead POV actually accomplished. Setting up an
interpretive précis places a still higher burden on you as analyst than does the synthetic précis: you must specify the
focus (the interpretive issue that the précis will address, drawn from the lead text), and then the goal or purpose that will
be realized by applying that lead to another text -- all choices made before you start assembling the chart of data from
the two texts. The chart logic may well be an "issue/example" logic, with the issues drawn systematically from the lead
text (first column) and then applied to examples from the text to be interpreted (second column). The interpretation you
are setting up will not be particularly successful if the lead text is not represented fairly and systematically. The
Assessment of this précis type is often directed at explaining why you bothered to set up this interpretation this way --
what it is good for.
How do I turn a précis into an essay, and what kinds of essays are they?
An analytic précis turns into something like a good book review or proposal evaluation -- the introduction
introduces the central issue and the rhetorical tactic that the source text (issue, or party) uses, together with the writer's
goal in bothering to explain these. The body of the paper fleshes out how the text's logic structures the argument, and
presents interim evaluations that set up the overall evaluation that is your essay's conclusion.
A synthetic précis sets up a paper that presents and resolves a conflict or choice in the favor of the first or
second party, justifies a preference, or shows how the two positions are totally compatible (despite their seeming
differences). The introduction for its essay version states the basis for the comparison and the strategy through which
the comparison will be documented. The essay growing out of it will end by assessing why and stating how this
comparison is illustrative or important. The body of the paper must contain a balanced presentation of comparable points
(each comparison introduced in terms of the more general overview encompassed in the paper's introduction). The
conclusion assesses and argues which side wins -- which needs/problems are more properly addressed in the
information presented; the Assessment may include a critique of each text's adequacy to the task.
An interpretive précis applies a point of view to a text and so is the ground for an essay or OP/ED piece,
offering a systematic consideration of an issue or problem. The essay introduction states which systematic POV will be
applied to what issue (yours or one drawn from another text or situation), why that point of view was chosen as the lead
text of the argument, how and to what other text the point of view will be applied (strategy/goal of the evaluation), what
data will be addressed, and what the goal of the particular interpretation will be (why it's worthwhile to set this analysis
up this way). The body of the paper must contain a running dialogue between the POV and the textual information
presented to bolster the argument being made; even if an essay based on the writer's own POV, the paper is not just a
reaction, it is an argument, concluding with reflections assessing the limitations of the argument made.

RELIGIOUS HOLIDAYS AND OTHER ABSENCES
• By UT Austin policy, you must notify the instructor and TA of your pending absence at least fourteen days
prior to the date of observance of a religious holy day. If you must miss a class, an examination, a work
assignment, or a project in order to observe a religious holy day, you will be given an opportunity to complete
the missed work within a reasonable time after the absence.
• The same applies to official university obligations like Club or Varsity sports, which usually provide
documentation of planned away games at the start of each semester.
• Documentation from a physician is required for medical absence; arrangements for work to be made up must
be made promptly.
• In no case should the work be completed more than 2 weeks after the absence.
• Other absences (e.g. family events) must be arranged for at least TWO WEEKS IN ADVANCE and missed

CHEATING AND PLAGIARISM
All students fall under the UT Honor Code:

The core values of the University of Texas at Austin are learning, discovery, freedom, leadership,
individual opportunity, and responsibility. Each member of the University is expected to uphold
these values through integrity, honesty, trust, fairness, and respect toward peers and community.
< http://registrar.utexas.edu/catalogs/gi09-10/ch01 />
Cheating and other forms of scholastic dishonesty, including plagiarism, will be reported to the Dean of
Students. Cheating on tests or plagiarism on papers will mean an F for the assignment, with no makeup possible. If
you engage in any form of scholastic dishonesty more than once, you will receive an automatic F for the course.
If you are unsure about the exact definition of scholastic dishonesty, you should consult the information
about academic integrity produced by the Dean of Students Office:
<http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acint_student.php>.
Plagiarism means using words or ideas that are not your own without citing your sources and without
indicating explicitly what you have taken from those sources. If you are unsure about what constitutes plagiarism,
consult: <http://www.lib.utexas.edu/services/instruction/learningmodules/plagiarism/>.
See the UT Honor Code or an additional explanation or example of what constitutes plagiarism (
http://registrar.utexas.edu/catalogs/gi09-10/ch01/index.html).
What does "citing your sources" mean? It means providing appropriate footnotes and bibliographic entries.
See <http://www.lib.utexas.edu/services/instruction/learningmodules/citations/>. To make correct citations,
researchers often use bibliographic software like UT's "Noodlebib" <http://www.lib.utexas.edu/noodlebib/> or Zotero
<http://www.zotero.com>. The PCL Library offers free classes on how to you them at the start of every semester. Sign
up now.

alarm is activated or an announcement is made. Alarm activation or announcement requires exiting and assembling
outside.

Please be aware of the following policies regarding evacuation:
o Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of the classroom and the building. Remember that the
nearest exit door may not be the one you used when you entered the building.
o If you require assistance to evacuate, inform your TA in writing during the first week of class.
o In the event of an evacuation, follow my instructions or those of class instructors.
o Do not re-enter a building unless you’re given instructions by the Austin Fire Department, the UT
Austin Police Department, or the Fire Prevention Services office.

Q DROP POLICY AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT DATES
• Texas law limits the number of course drops for academic reasons to six. Senate Bill 1231 says:
Beginning with the fall 2007 academic term, an institution of higher education may not permit an
undergraduate student a total of more than six dropped courses, including any course a transfer
student has dropped at another institution of higher institution of higher education, unless the
student shows good cause for dropping more than that number.
• Note that the dates for dropping courses and changing grades are indicated in the University Academic
Calendar: < http://registrar.utexas.edu/calendars/ >. You are responsible for these dates; instructors
have NO control over them.
