Live Sessions: On select Wednesdays throughout the summer (see Course Schedule), I will hold live sessions
and exam reviews online via Zoom (time TBD) that will last approximately 45 minutes. Because the chosen
time may conflict with some students’ schedules, attendance is not mandatory and the live class sessions and
exam reviews will be recorded and uploaded to Canvas for future on‐demand viewing by students who are
unable to attend. The live class sessions will review additional content that will be covered in the exams but is
not covered in the Canvas course units so please make sure you make time to watch them before the next
exam. You are not required to watch the live exam reviews. Please note that you are also always welcome to
schedule an office hours appointment with me for any questions you may have or any topics you want to
discuss in more depth.
Practice Activities: Practice activities will help you understand and apply the content covered in each of
the lessons within a unit. These activities come in several forms including interactive activities within the
HBP Core Curriculum readings, multiple‐choice questions, and other written responses. All 27 practice
2 | F o u n d a ti o n s o f M a r k e ti n g‐ S p r i n g 2 0 2 1

activities are graded on a Complete/Incomplete basis, and the percentage complete will be the basis for this
grade component.
Reading Checks: Throughout the course, there are 31 brief reading checks. These are non‐cumulative
quizzes based on the unit readings and activities you complete. These reading checks contain a few
multiple‐choice or true and false questions. Start the quizzes after you have completed and thoroughly
reviewed all of the unit content and are comfortable with the concepts. Although these quizzes are “open
book,” you are highly encouraged to attempt on your own as important practice for the exams. Each
student’s lowest 2 quiz grades will be dropped, and the average of the remaining quizzes will be the basis for
this grade component.
Discussions: During the course you will have the opportunity to express your thoughts and interact with
other classmates using structured discussion forums. Each of the 7 discussion assignments will be
reviewed and assigned 1, 2, or 3 points credit:
• 3 points for outstanding level of completion
• 2 points for good level of completion
• 1 point for incomplete or poor level of completion
• 0 points for missing assignments
Exams: There will be four exams available (three non‐cumulative exams and one cumulative final exam) and
only the three highest grades will be counted. The exams will be primarily composed of multiple‐choice
questions and are “closed note” and “closed‐book”. The exams are designed to have a one‐hour normal time
limit for each exam, but two hours are allocated for those needing extra time (SSD accommodations). Exams
must be taken on the scheduled date and will be taken online through Canvas and monitored via Proctorio.
If you are unable to take an exam on the scheduled date, you will receive a 0 for that exam; however, the
lowest grade of the four exams will be dropped, meaning you can miss one exam without incurring a grade
penalty in this course. You are also welcome to take all four exams, and the lowest grade will be dropped.
Late Assignments and Responsibility of Turning in Work Properly: Assignments are due at designated times as
outlined on the course schedule. Assignments submitted after the due date and time will receive 50% credit, if
submitted within 24 hours of the due date and time. Assignments submitted more than 24 hours after the
original deadline will not receive any credit. Please leave sufficient time to complete the required activities and
the corresponding assessments to avoid being penalized for unplanned issues, unforeseen emergencies, and
technical difficulties. To maintain fairness to all students in the course, there are NO extensions and NO make‐
up assignments.
Extra Credit Research Opportunities: You can earn up to two extra credit points on your final grade in the
course by participating in research studies through the Marketing Department Subject Pool. You can earn one
point for each study you participate in. For instance, to earn two points, you must participate in two different
studies. Please note, if you participate in more than two studies than, you will not earn any additional credit
beyond two points. You can find all extra credit opportunities for this course at the Marketing Department
Subject Pool website at: http://mccombs.sona‐systems.com. You can expect to receive your login information
for SONA by the 3rd class day (June 4th). If June 4th has passed, and you have not received your login
information, you can email the lab coordinator (see below).

You are strongly encouraged to participate in these studies. It is a good way to get exposed to marketing
research, and it is valuable to understanding marketing and consumer behavior. These opportunities are
offered throughout the semester, but will end before August 5th, so plan ahead. All extra credit opportunities
for this course will be held ONLINE. Below are instructions on how to access these online studies:
Login with your username (EID) and password. Click “VIEW AVAILABLE STUDIES.” Then click the session you
would like to complete. You will be taken to a page with the study description, and you will be prompted to
sign up. Only after you sign up for the session will you be given access. You will see an orange button that says
"Complete Survey Now."

participation until after the last day of classes.
Instructor Bio: I grew up in Austin, TX and earned my BA degrees in Economics and History from the University
of Texas at Austin. After college, I worked for five years at Hill+Knowlton Strategies conducting market
research for a wide a variety of clients all over the world from Fortune 50 firms to local non‐profits. A majority
of my consulting work focused on corporate crisis management, stakeholder management, messaging,
marketing research, and long‐term corporate reputation management.
I went back to UT and earned my Ph.D. in Marketing at the McCombs School of Business. As a researcher, I like
to investigate questions related to marketing strategy and leadership. Specifically, my most recent work
investigates the influence of female representation in the C‐suite on customer orientation as well as factors
that impact leadership decision‐making during social media crises.
I am currently on an academic leave of absence to serve as the CMO of Calque Inc., a fintech startup. In my
spare time, I like to ride horses, bike, cook (which is more attempted than succeeded), travel, do yoga, and
read (especially Harry Potter).
Course Outline and Deadlines: The schedule below highlights key dates for assignments, exams, and live
classes. Following this schedule will ensure you complete the course on time. Please feel free to move
through the course more quickly than these deadlines, but you must complete the assignments by the
required due dates to receive credit. It is a good idea to work at least a day or two ahead of these
deadlines to anticipate unforeseen emergencies.

Important Notifications
Proctorio is a secure monitoring platform that integrates with Canvas and ONLY works within the Chrome
web browser. Please read the information here: https://wikis.utexas.edu/display/MSBTech/Exams
 Make sure you’re using the Chrome browser on a desktop or laptop computer. Tablet and phone support
is not available.
 Make sure your computer is plugged into a power outlet and not running on battery.
 Proctorio Chrome Extension settings (you can turn these off after you complete the quiz or exam)
 Click the Proctorio extension (shield icon) and select "Manage Extensions" .
 Scroll down and make sure the option "Allow this extension to read and change all your data on websites
you visit" is set to "On all sites". NOTE: You can always turn off this setting later after the exam.
 Check to be sure the "Allow in incognito" setting is enabled (the slider should be blue).
 You may need to refresh the page or reload the test for these settings to take effect.
 If checking/modifying the settings does not work, remove and reinstall the extension. Note: the Proctorio
extension often reloads with the "Allow in incognito" setting disabled, so walk through the steps above
again after reinstalling.
 As a best practice, it helps to reboot your computer before you take a quiz or exam that uses Proctorio.
These tips can reduce issues with Proctorio’s camera check of your webcam and mic that runs at the
start. Before starting the quiz:
 Only open Chrome, close all other programs.
 Make sure you’re in a room that is quiet with good lighting with no glare.
 Make sure your face is close enough to your camera and not too far away.
 If you are wearing glasses you may need to remove them during the camera check that runs at the start.
If the webcam or microphone fail when Proctorio tests your hardware, it is likely an issue with your computer
or browser so:
 First, try the links they provide to troubleshoot your issues.
 If that doesn’t help, use the Live Chat feature to talk to someone at Proctorio to resolve your issue. Do not
ignore this option because Proctorio Support is experienced in resolving issues
 Mac users may need to change permissions to allow third‐party apps to control microphone and webcam.
 If you get an alert that your computer is lacking RAM and could crash, still attempt to take the quiz or
exam. RAM memory is a regular issue.
 If you have an extension for another proctoring service, besides Proctorio, you need to disable it.
 To contact Proctorio for more assistance, use the live chat option from the extension, or go
to https://proctorio.com/support
 Your instructors and TAs are NOT equipped to provide technical support.
Statement on Learning Success: Your success in this class is important to me. We will all need
accommodations because we all learn differently. If there are aspects of this course that prevent you from
learning or exclude you, please let me know as soon as possible. Together we’ll develop strategies to meet
both your needs and the requirements of the course. I also encourage you to reach out to the student
resources available through UT.

Diversity and Inclusion: It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well
served by this course, that students’ learning needs be addressed and that the diversity that students bring to
this class can be comfortably expressed and be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit to all students.
Please come to me at any time with any concerns.

Code of Ethics: The McCombs School of Business has no tolerance for acts of scholastic dishonesty. The
responsibilities of both students and faculty with regard to scholastic dishonesty are described in detail in
the BBA Program’s Statement on Scholastic Dishonesty at https://my.mccombs.utexas.edu/bba/about‐
us/code‐of‐ethics/. By teaching this course, I have agreed to observe all faculty responsibilities described in
that document. By enrolling in this class, you have agreed to observe all student responsibilities described in
that document. If the application of the Statement on Scholastic Dishonesty to this class or its assignments is
unclear in any way, it is your responsibility to ask me for clarification. Students who violate University rules
on scholastic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary penalties, including the possibility of failure in the course
and/or dismissal from the University. Since dishonesty harms the individual, all students, the integrity of the
University, and the value of our academic brand, policies on scholastic dishonesty will be strictly
enforced. You should refer to the Student Judicial Services website
at http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/ to access the official University policies and procedures on
scholastic dishonesty as well as further elaboration on what constitutes scholastic dishonesty.
Academic Integrity: Students of the University of Texas and this course may not share or distribute
materials that could be an advantage to another current or future student, and the university has no
tolerance for acts of scholastic dishonesty. More on UT’s policy of Academic Dishonesty and Cheating here:
https://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/conduct/.
Class Recording Privacy: Class recordings are reserved only for the use of members of this class (students,
TAs, and the instructor) and only for educational purposes. Recordings should not be shared outside the
class or posted in any form. Violation of this restriction could lead to Student Misconduct proceedings. For
more information, please see FAQs on Student Confidentiality (FERPA) Issues Associated with Recordings.
Sharing of Course Materials is Prohibited: No materials used in this class, including, but not limited to, lecture
hand‐outs, videos, assessments (quizzes, exams, papers, projects, homework assignments), in‐class materials,
review sheets, and additional problem sets, may be shared online or with anyone outside of the class without
explicit, written permission of the instructor. Unauthorized sharing of materials promotes cheating. It is a
violation of the University’s Student Honor Code and an act of academic dishonesty. The University is well
aware of the sites used for sharing materials, and any materials found on such sites that are associated with a
specific student, or any suspected unauthorized sharing of materials, will be reported to Student Conduct and
Academic Integrity in the Office of the Dean of Students. These reports can result in sanctions, including failure
of the course.

Title IX Reporting: Title IX is a federal law that protects against sex and gender‐based discrimination, sexual
harassment, sexual assault, sexual misconduct, dating/domestic violence and stalking at federally funded
educational institutions. UT Austin is committed to fostering a learning and working environment free from
discrimination in all its forms. When sexual misconduct occurs in our community, the university can:
1. Intervene to prevent harmful behavior from continuing or escalating.
2. Provide support and remedies to students and employees who have experienced harm or have
become involved in a Title IX investigation.
3. Investigate and discipline violations of the university’s relevant policies.
Beginning January 1, 2020, Texas Senate Bill 212 requires all employees of Texas universities, including faculty,
report any information to the Title IX Office regarding sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating violence and
stalking that is disclosed to them. Texas law requires that all employees who witness or receive any
information of this type (including, but not limited to, writing assignments, class discussions, or one‐on‐one
conversations) must be reported. I am a Responsible Employee and must report any Title IX related incidents
that are disclosed in writing, discussion, or one‐on‐one. Before talking with me, or with any faculty or staff
member about a Title IX related incident, be sure to ask whether they are a responsible employee. If you
would like to speak with someone who can provide support or remedies without making an official report to
the university, please email advocate@austin.utexas.edu. For more information about reporting options and
resources, visit http://www.titleix.utexas.edu/, contact the Title IX Office via email at
titleix@austin.utexas.edu, or call 512‐471‐0419.
Although graduate teaching and research assistants are not subject to Texas Senate Bill 212, they are still
mandatory reporters under Federal Title IX laws and are required to report a wide range of behaviors we refer
to as sexual misconduct, including the types of sexual misconduct covered under Texas Senate Bill 212. The
Title IX office has developed supportive ways to respond to a survivor and compiled campus resources to
support survivors.
