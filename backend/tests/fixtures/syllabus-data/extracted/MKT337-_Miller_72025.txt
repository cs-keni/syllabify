REQUIRED TEXT
Essentials of Marketing, 17th Edition by William Perreault, Joseph Cannon, and E. Jerome
McCarthy (ISBN: 9781260570915)
Supplementary in-class lecture material from external sources will also be presented. Attending
class is key to your success in this course.
COURSE DESCRIPTION
The primary objective of Marketing 337 will be to introduce you to the basic concepts, practices
and tools of marketing. The course has a broad scope, is contemporary in outlook, and managerial
in orientation. Regardless of the field you ultimately choose to pursue, this course should give you
a strong grounding in the marketing discipline.
For marketing majors, you will find that this course provides a strong foundation for your future
studies and work opportunities. As we will quickly learn in class, however, “marketing” is not just
for marketing majors. It is not simply a function or a department. Instead, marketing is a process
which allows an organization to create and deliver value for customers – hopefully more value
than competitors offer – and therefore provides the engine for organic growth of an organization.
No matter what field you study in college and what career you eventually pursue, your success in
1

business will be largely determined by your ability to deliver more value to customers than your
competitors.
More specifically, in this class you will have the opportunity to…:
1. …understand that “marketing” is the discipline that drives how organizations can achieve
superior organic growth.
2. …explain and apply the marketing process (i.e., developing promising configurations of
insights, strategies, and execution) that gears the organization for growth
3. …analyze and apply the marketing mix instruments (i.e., key tools and concepts pertaining to
product management, price management, communication management, and sales
management)
COURSE OBJECTIVES
This course is designed to introduce business students to the principles of marketing as they relate
to the whole business enterprise. This course will be focusing on the understanding and application
of key marketing concepts. Memorization of the material in the text will not be sufficient.
Attendance in lectures and the participation in discussions during class will cement the concepts,
allow you to apply them to real business problems, and prepare you for the exams.
I will provide insight into the way in which customer wants and needs are transformed into a firm’s
strategies and tactics. This course will consist of class lectures, textbook, speakers, films, articles,
and cases all designed to give you a comprehensive understanding of marketing.
1. To provide you with knowledge of the history of marketing activities and the evolution of the
modern marketing system.
2. To heighten your awareness of the interaction between business and society as it relates to
marketing activities.
3. To expand your understanding of the marketing system and basic marketing vocabulary.
4. To develop your understanding of basic marketing activities and ways that marketing relates
to other business activities.
5. To sharpen your analysis of business strategy and tactics from a marketing person’s
perspective.
6. To provide you with a framework for developing marketing strategy and a working
understanding of tools and tactics useful in implementing marketing strategy.
NATURE OF THE COURSE
The course will be taught in-person. I will personalize the class with outside information, guest
speakers, films, and personal business experiences. In addition to this material, the course will
include discussions of articles on “current events” related to marketing. You will be responsible
for all speakers, films, and personal business examples covered in each class.
Several guest lecturers may be invited to class. They have special marketing expertise that will
enrich the course content. There may be questions on examinations or quizzes from material that
is presented by the guest lecturers.
2

As much as possible I will try to involve you in all the course material by asking for your opinions
and comments on topics as they are covered in class. Please feel free to ask questions in class in
order to enhance your learning and understanding of marketing concepts. As we cover different
aspects of marketing, you will probably notice examples of marketing in the world around you. I
encourage you to keep up with current events in business and marketing by regularly reading the
popular business press, such as Business Week, Financial Times, USA Today (money section),
Fortune, Forbes, and The Wall Street Journal.
Business Week, USA Today, and Forbes are free to access the majority of content. Fortune is
behind a paywall. University of Texas students can access The Wall Street Journal online and
Financial Times online for free (though the Financial Times articles are delayed 30 days for
students) by following the link below:
https://guides.lib.utexas.edu/market/CNews
We will cover a great deal of information throughout the semester. In addition, each new topic in
the course builds on previously covered material. It is essential that you remain current in your
assignments, reading the appropriate text chapters prior to the class in which the relevant material
will be covered. This will both enhance your understanding of the lecture material and enable you
to comment and contribute in class.
The class lecture will consist of PPT slides covering material in the textbook, PPT slides from
outside sources, videos, articles, guest speakers, personal marketing experiences, and current
examples of marketing practices. You will be responsible for all material covered in class,
including PPT slides not included in the Canvas postings.
I would like to learn more about each of you personally. Please, feel free to take the time to “visit”
me or your TA during virtual office hours.
CLASS POLICIES AND EXPECTATIONS
Class sessions will include lecture, discussion, test, and other activities. The class sessions will be
based on content from the textbook, assigned readings, guest speakers, and videos. The keys to
having a successful experience in this class include:
1. Commit yourself to learn the concepts presented in this class. Don’t simply memorize
vocabulary words.
2. Be present at every class. At least ¼ of the questions on all exams will be based on lectures,
other in-class activities, and the ensuing discussions that take place in class.
3. Stay current with Canvas. Look at Canvas announcements for weekly updates, import
class notices, and grades. It is your responsibility to check Canvas regularly.
4. Take notes during class on all material, including the videos and speakers.
5. Please turn off your cell phone ring tone and remain on mute unless you have a question.
6. Participate in class discussion and ask questions, particularly with guest lecturers.
3

7. The material in this class builds on itself. Do not get behind. Read assigned chapters and
articles prior to the class in which they will be discussed. This will provide you with an
overview of the concepts and vocabulary so that our class lecture discussion will be much
more meaningful.
8. Observe the marketing principles we discuss in class you journey through your daily life:
● Read articles in the business press (e.g. Wall Street Journal, Business Week, etc.)
and think about the marketing implications for you, other consumers, the
organizations, the industry, the economy, and society.
● Think about the reasons why you buy a certain brand of clothes, beverages, or cars.
● Consider why products you buy are priced the way they are.
● Observe how many forms of advertising you encounter every day.
● Consider how diverse consumers can be and the effect this has on marketing
strategy.
● Reverse engineer the marketing efforts you are exposed to and understanding how
these efforts utilize (or don’t utilize) the marketing principles we discuss in this
class.
9. Conduct yourselves professionally. This includes “arriving” to class on time, turning off
your cell phones, remaining on mute during lecture unless you have a question, refraining
from personal conversations during class, remaining focused on the material presented
instead of distractions, and being respectful of your classmates, guest speakers, the TA
and your instructor.
In general, students are expected to conduct themselves in accordance with the University
of Texas Code of Conduct and the Honor Code. You can review the Code of Conduct and
the Honor Code at the link provided:
https://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/conduct/standardsofconduct.php
Students who engage in unprofessional conduct or conduct against the University of Texas
Code of Conduct may be subject to disciplinary action, including but not limited to
temporary removal from the classroom setting.
10. I have no tolerance for acts of academic dishonesty. Such acts damage the reputation of
the University of Texas and the degree and demean the honest efforts of the majority of
students. The minimum penalty for act of academic dishonesty will be a zero for that
assignment or exam.

GRADING
Your grade in the course will be determined on the basis of three examinations. Each exam will
include 40 multiple-choice questions. The questions will cover all the material covered in the
TEXTBOOK (TEXT AND GRAPHS), CLASS LECTURES, CLASS SPEAKERS, FILMS,
ARTICLES AND CASES DISCUSSED IN CLASS. You are responsible for everything
covered in the previously stated areas. There will be no curves given on the exams; however, if
questions are judged to be worthy of consideration an adjustment may be given to ensure fairness.
All exams will be available for review for ONLY one week following the posted grades. After
the one-week period, the exams are no longer available for review.
(Because of the size of the class, we cannot extend this beyond the stated time frame).
Final grades will be assigned based on your semester average as follows:
Semester Grade
Average Grade Points
93-100 A 4.00
90-92 A- 3.67
87-89 B+ 3.33
83-86 B 3.00
80-82 B- 2.67
77-79 C+ 2.33
73-76 C 2.00
70-72 C- 1.67
67-69 D+ 1.33
63-66 D 1.00
60-62 D- 0.67
59 or less F 0.00
Decimals will not be rounded up. (e.g. 89.7 average will be considered an “B+”, not an “A-”).
THIS CLASS IS NOT PASS/FAIL. YOUR GRADES WILL BE RECORDED.
VERY IMPORTANT!!!…In calculating your final course grade, you must use the below stated
“grading formula/percentages” – NOT CANVAS!!! CANVAS IS ‘NOT’ AN ACCURATE
WAY TO DETERMINE YOUR OVERALL COURSE GRADE, ONLY THE BELOW
STATED GRADING FORMULA/ PERCENTAGES IS CORRECT. If you have any
questions, please contact me or your class TA.
To be fair to all students, grade changes or additional extra credit opportunities will not be
considered. There will be no exceptions. No arguments about +s or –s because this would
remove the benefits of the +/- system, which was introduced to insure a more accurate
grading system. The way to get the grade that you want is by EARNING it during the
semester.

CLASS EXAMS, ASSIGNMENTS, & PROJECTS
Examinations (90% of Final Grade)
There will be three exams, each comprising 30% of your course grade. The exams will include
both multiple-choice and short answer questions. Exams will cover assigned chapters in the
textbook, other assigned readings, lectures, class exercises, class discussions, videos, and guest
speakers. You are responsible for everything covered in the previously stated areas. The
emphasis on these exams will be on the application of concepts. Understanding of text material
and knowledge of definitions are expected since they may be test material.
Each exam will ONLY be provided during the regular class period on the dates specified above
at the start of our regular class time of 12:00 PM. Please consult the calendar and establish that
the exam dates/times will not conflict with your schedule during the first day of class. You must
take the exam on the date and time indicated above and in the class calendar.
No alternative test dates or times will be provided except as required for those students
presenting a letter of accommodation from the Dean of Students SSD office, students observing
religious holy days, and students dealing with health emergencies. No make-up dates are
offered for students who miss an exam. Remember that if you miss an exam, you will be given
a zero.
Exam grades will be posted on Canvas as soon as possible after the exam. The TA will provide an
opportunity for you to review your exam, find out exactly which questions you missed and to
discuss any of the questions on the exam for one week following the date of the exam during posted
office hours only. After reviewing your exam, you may submit a written appeal on any question
for which you believe there is some cause for review. Appeals must be submitted by the announced
deadline, generally within 1 week after the grades are posted. No grade discussions of any kind
(other than to correct data entry or calculation errors) will occur at the end of the semester.
Article Summaries (10% of Final Grade)
Students will be asked to write and turn in two summaries on articles provided to them via
Canvas. These articles will be discussed in class as a part of the subject being lectured on that
day. Article summaries should be no more than 2 pages double-spaced in Times New Roman
font size 12 with 1” margins.
Articles, the write up deadlines, and information on how to write an article summary will be
posted to Canvas. The write ups will be due by the start of class on the day it is due. Please
submit via Canvas. Late article summaries are unacceptable and will receive a zero if not turned
in by 1:00 PM on the day it is due. There Will Not Be Any Exceptions!
Marketing Department Research Studies (Extra Credit Opportunity)
See detailed description in this section.
CLASS GRADE CALCULATION
6

Exam #1 30% Chapters 1-6
Exam #2 30% Chapters 7-11
Exam #3 30% Chapters 12-14-15, 17-18
Article Summaries 10% Two 2-page article summaries
Two MKT DEPT 2 points will be added to your “lowest exam grade”
Research Studies for each extra credit study you complete, for a possible
total of 4 points. For example, if you have an 80% score on
your lowest exam and you do two marketing department
studies, you will receive 84% for that exam and if you do
one, you will receive 82%. Points are not added to your raw
score; only to your percentage score.
MEETING YOUR GRADE GOALS
First, review this syllabus and the course requirements carefully. There are many opportunities
provided to help you succeed in this course. However, you must take advantages of them
throughout the semester. Please note that grades are based on your inputs, not your effort, nor
your improvement. I expect each of you to have the time management skills to evaluate course
requirements, complete them on time, and accept the consequences of your choices.
Please see the instructor or TA for guidance early in the semester if you are not meeting your
grade goals. Your TA will not provide notes for missed classes! A buddy system where a fellow
student can take notes for you and you for them due to an absence is a smart idea.
It is always disappointing to hear from students at the end of the semester who did not take
advantage of the available resources during the semester and are a point away from a higher
grade. Do not be the one of them! All choices – even ‘right’ ones – have consequences, so
skipping class/studying less to meet other legitimate life needs will not excuse you from
receiving the grade you earn in this class. The instructor will not discuss or consider any grade
changes at the end of the semester (regardless of special circumstances, improvement, good
intentions, needs, desires, etc.) so please put your effort into this class throughout the semester
and accept the consequences of your choices.
EXTRA CREDIT MARKETING DEPT RESEARCH STUDIES
You can earn extra credit points in the course by participating in research studies through the Marketing
Department Subject Pool. You can earn one point for each study you participate in. For instance, to earn
two points, you must participate in two different studies. Please note, if you participate in more studies
than what your professor has allowed, you will not earn any additional credit.
You can find all extra credit opportunities for this course at the Marketing Department Subject Pool
website at:

You can expect to receive your login information for SONA by the 3rd class day (June 6th). If June 6th
has passed, and you have not received your login information, you can email the lab coordinator (below).
You are strongly encouraged to participate in these studies. It is a good way to get exposed to marketing
research, and it is valuable to understanding marketing and consumer behavior. These opportunities are
offered throughout the semester, but will end before July 1st, so plan ahead.
All extra credit opportunities for this course will be held ONLINE. Below are instructions on how to
access these online studies:

STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES
Students with disabilities may request appropriate academic accommodations from the Division
of Diversity and Community Engagement, Services for Students with Disabilities, 471-6259.
Letter should be brought to the attention of the TA at the beginning of the semester to arrange
accommodations. This must be submitted within two weeks of the start of the semester.
TA: Your TA should be contacted on all grade, review, test, speaker, article, textbook, and
absence issues, etc. Feel free to copy me on all email correspondence. Your TA will NOT
provide notes for missed classes!
Students who use TA office hours regularly to ask questions about course material or simply to
ask directions regarding study methods tend to do better in class.
ACADEMIC DISHONESTY
Marketing 337 will operate in full compliance with the Policy Statement on Scholastic
Dishonesty for the College of Business Administration, which is described in detail at

the results of any TurnItIn submission, the faculty member will make the final determination as
to whether or not a paper has been plagiarized.
FINAL THOUGHTS
Please take advantage of the opportunities in this course. I am here to help you learn as much as
possible about marketing strategies and concepts. Please keep in mind that this is a dynamic
course that incorporates the growth and changes in the field of marketing. Marketing requires
you to integrate, to be imaginative, and to be decisive in situations with limited information.

the skills and knowledge you have learned in this class in whatever path you take in your career.
At the same time, I will give you valuable insight into the real world that will benefit you as you
pursue a career in an increasingly global marketplace.
Foremost, this course should be very enjoyable. You will get out of this class what YOU put
into it. If you will commit yourself to preparation, apply yourself to the tasks at hand, and then
open yourself up to learn and succeed. I think you will find this one of most enjoyable practical
courses you will take in your college career. It will DEFINITELY help you get Ahead in Life.
