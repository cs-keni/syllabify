This course makes use of the web-based Quest content delivery and homework server system maintained by the
College of Natural Sciences. This homework service will require a $30 charge per student for its use, which goes toward
the maintenance and operation of the resource. Please go to http://quest.cns.utexas.edu to log in to the Quest system
for this class. After the 12th day of class, when you log into Quest you will be asked to pay via credit card on a secure
payment site. You have the option to wait up to 30 days to pay while still continuing to use Quest for your assignments. If
you are taking more than one course using Quest, you will not be charged more than $60/semester. For payment
questions, email quest.fees@cns.utexas.edu.
This course carries the Quantitative Reasoning flag.
This course may be used to fulfill three hours of the natural science and technology (Part I or Part II) component of
the university core curriculum and addresses the following four core objectives established by the Texas Higher
Education Coordinating Board––communication skills, critical thinking skills, teamwork, and empirical and quantitative
skills, via homework, exams, class participation, and section meetings.
