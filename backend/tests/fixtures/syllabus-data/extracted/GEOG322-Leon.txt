Textbook: Key concepts in geomorphology, 2nd Edition (2020) by Paul Bierman and David Montgomery.
This will be available through the University Book Store; there is also an ebook version available for
purchase or rental online which is fine. Do NOT use the 1st edition – many things have been changed
with the introduction of the 2nd edition.
Course Description and Learning Objectives: Geography 322 covers surficial geomorphic processes
(including landslides, rivers, glaciers, wind, and coastal processes), landform development, and
landscape evolution. By the end of the course, you should be able to:
1) explain how geomorphic processes, such as river flow, waves on a beach, wind, and glaciers, create
specific landforms;
2) recognize and interpret landforms on maps, air photos and in the field; and
3) use basic quantitative techniques of geomorphology to measure and compare landform
characteristics and to determine rates and magnitudes of processes.
This course provides a foundation for GEOG 427: Fluvial Geomorphology, as well as other related classes
in Geography and Earth Sciences.
Division of Labor:
Instructor (Fonstad): Class presentations, Exam management & general questions
Graduate Employees (Maze & Huelbig): Lab instruction, Lab evaluation, Lab Content Development

Weekly Labs: Labs provide practical experiences for completing geomorphic analyses. The labs will be
introduced in-person and many parts of individual labs will be using in-person materials, but some labs
will have portions to be completed by students on their own time. You are free to work with others on
these exercises, but make sure that you do your own calculations and your own write-ups for these
exercises. Do not copy each others’ written answers. I expect the exercises to be written up with a
professional level of writing quality and presentation. The lab instructors will provide a detailed
schedule of when labs are due to each lab section.
Evaluation and Grading:
(1) Weekly Labs -- 60% (9 total, drop lowest score lab, each of remaining 8 worth 7.5%)
(2) Exams – 40% (2 total, each worth 20%)
Late weekly labs are deducted 25% of total possible after the deadline, +25% deducted for each
additional week late.
Exams are on May 8 and June 13. Exams are closed-book and in-person. If you have an official AEC
request for this (for example, longer time for exams), let me know at the beginning of term and I will
work to accommodate these requests. No make-up tests will be given unless you provide
documentation in advance and for a reason that is valid in the instructor’s judgment.
The final grade scale is as follows: A+: >98; A: 92-98; A-: 90-92; B+: 88-90; B: 82-88; B-: 80-82; C+: 78-80;
C: 72-78; C-: 70-72%; D+: 68-70; D: 62-68; D-: 60-62; F: <60.
Grade Bump Requests Will NOT be Honored

Participation: While attendance at lecture is not mandatory (other than exams), you are strongly
encouraged to attend every lecture in order to gain the knowledge crucial for understanding the course
material and for doing well on lab exercises and exams. While lab attendance is technically not required,
both the introductions to the labs and many of the materials (and instructor aid) to complete the labs
will be during the lab periods, so from a practical standpoint you will need to attend lab. During lectures
and labs please be respectful of everyone’s learning experience. This includes having phones turned off,
computers to be used only for class-related activities, extraneous noise kept to a minimum, etc.
Contacting us: The fastest way to contact us is via email. When asking questions about the policies of
the class, remember that the exercise and exam dates, as well as policies on late/make-up work, are
clearly stated in this syllabus. We may not be able to be contacted on evenings, weekends, and holidays.
Academic Dishonesty: We will not tolerate cheating or academic misconduct/dishonesty in my courses;
examples of these behaviors include (but are not limited to):
• Plagiarism (passing off the work of another as that of your own)
• Any other actions that might give you an unfair advantage over your classmates.
All cases of academic dishonesty/misconduct will be referred immediately to the Student Judicial Affairs
Office. The penalties for engaging in academic dishonesty and/or misconduct can range from a grade of
“F” for an exercise or quiz to an automatic failure of the course. Please consult the university policy at
https://dos.uoregon.edu/social-misconduct
Disability Services Notice: I work hard to ensure a quality learning experience for all students. If you
need specific accommodations to get the most out of this class, please let me know by (1) informing me
of your particular needs, and (2) providing the appropriate documentation from the university’s AEC
office. I will make every effort to accommodate your needs, but you must notify me by the first week of
class if you need special arrangements.
Note: I consider this syllabus a contract between myself and the students in this course. In writing this
syllabus, I have obligated myself to follow the policies and procedures contained herein. You are
responsible for understanding and following these policies as well. I reserve the right to make changes
to this syllabus. You will receive verbal and written notification of major changes to course policies,
procedures and content.
