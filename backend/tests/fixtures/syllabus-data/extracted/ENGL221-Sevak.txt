Course Description

Focusing on major writers and their cultural contexts, ENGL221 surveys British literature to 1798. A remarkable amount of important work was produced over this period. Students will read major texts like Beowulf, Doctor Faustus, and Paradise Lost; learn about renowned authors such as Chaucer, Shakespeare, and Milton, as well as less studied but equally important figures such as Margaret Cavendish and Olaudah Equiano. They will be introduced to influential literary forms, such as the epic, the tragedy, and different forms of poetry like sonnets, elegies, and odes. The tradition of British literature evolved over periods of significant upheaval and change. Students will also learn about the shifting historical and ethical orientations that energized this tradition, from the Heroic Ethos to Christian Humanism to Neoclassicism. As an introductory survey of British literature, English 221 welcomes non majors: no previous course in literature is required. By reading and discussing some of the best-known works in British literature, students will sharpen their skills of interpretation while surveying an important literary tradition.

Course Objectives

Students will leave the course with a detailed knowledge of early English history and culture as displayed through these landmark works of literature. They will analyze these works with a critical attention that asks the following questions: why are these works so venerated still to this day? What is their relevance to our world? How did the English explore what it means to be human? How do we connect with their expressions of joy, pain, desire, grief, and loss? Who had the agency to tell stories during this period, and what voices are missing from the canon? Through class discussion, developing critical reading and writing skills, and thinking creatively about these texts, we will together explore these questions and consider their many answers.

Course Texts 

All texts will be given to you electronically, and you will be reading them using an online annotation app called Perusall (accessed through Canvas). You are free to purchase physical copies if you so choose. Please let me know if you are having trouble accessing any course materials.

Course Policies

Attendance:

Class attendance and evaluation of student performance are to occur in accordance with Academic Administrative Policy E-11. As indicated in this policy, “Class attendance is a critical element of student success and one of the most important ways students learn and understand course materials. Students may need to miss a class meeting to participate in a regularly scheduled university-approved curricular or extracurricular activity or due to unavoidable or other legitimate circumstances (including participation in local, state, and federal governmental elections and religious observances).”

Participation in class discussion is vital to understanding and engaging with these texts and your fellow classmates, so attendance in class is required. Absences for religious holidays, family or other emergencies, or sickness/quarantine, will be excused with no penalty. Your physical and mental health are vitally important, so please let me know before class if you will be unable to attend that day. If you do not communicate with me about absences and you miss more than 3 classes, I will contact you and your attendance/participation grade will be lowered accordingly for each additional absence.

Open and honest communication is the best policy here. I expect to be notified if you will not be in class (you do not have to give the reason). If you have a job, you don’t just skip without letting your boss know. Treat this class like a job and you will be fine.

Note on Participation: I expect you to come to class prepared with questions and/or comments on the material assigned to share with me and your classmates. There are many ways to participate in class; raising your hand and talking is only one of them. Being present (physically as well as mentally), reacting to what is being said, engaging in small group work and activities, sending me questions or ideas via email – all these actions show me that you are engaged with the class. That being said, this is a small class that will only be successful if you all are willing to share and be responsive to the course material. We will have periodic check-ins if necessary to ensure that the class dynamic is working for everyone. 

Electronics Policy: Computers and e-readers are allowed in class. I trust you to make wise choices about how you use your electronic devices during class, as I know that for some it is very useful to have them. Turning off notifications and shutting down email or social media browsers during class is advised to limit distractions. Any devices should also be silenced, and phones should be put away during class time. If you are easily distracted while working on a computer, I suggest finding a system that works better for you. If there is frequent misuse of devices in class, I will get more strict about this policy.

Note: Using generative AI tools like ChatGPT to write your papers is NOT permitted. The assignments in this class are meant to help you practice your critical writing, reading, and reasoning skills. Remember to ask the professor for help if you are struggling with an assignment. Remember, it’s called the HUMAN-ities for a reason!

Extension/Late Work Policies: All students have a 48 hour window after an assignment is due to turn it in without penalty. If you need a longer extension, you must ask for it at least 24 hours before the assignment is due. Just email me with a proposed alternate submission due date. Grades for work received late [past the window] with no extension granted will decrease 5% each day that it is late. Please keep track of due dates across your course load and prepare accordingly! I also know that life happens. As I say above regarding attendance, open and honest communication will always help you in this class. Communicate with me and we will find a solution together.

Email: I will do my utmost to respond to emails within 24 hours of their receipt. If I have not responded in that time, feel free to follow up. The exception to this is emails sent between 5pm Friday and 5pm Sunday, which I will try to respond to by the end of the workday on Monday.

ACADEMIC INTEGRITY 

Academic integrity is the pursuit of scholarly activity in an open, honest, and responsible manner. Academic integrity is a basic guiding principle for all academic activity at The Pennsylvania State University, and all members of the University community are expected to act in accordance with this principle.

According to Penn State policy G-9: Academic Integrity, an academic integrity violation is “an intentional, unintentional, or attempted violation of course or assessment policies to gain an academic advantage or to advantage or disadvantage another student academically.” Unless your instructor tells you otherwise, you must complete all course work entirely on your own, using only sources that have been permitted by your instructor, and you may not assist other students with papers, quizzes, exams, or other assessments. If your instructor allows you to use ideas, images, or word phrases created by another person (e.g., from Course Hero or Chegg) or by generative technology, such as ChatGPT, you must identify their source. You may not submit false or fabricated information, use the same academic work for credit in multiple courses, or share instructional content. Please be aware that Turnitin may be utilized as a plagiarism detection tool in this course. Students with questions about academic integrity should ask their instructor before submitting work.

Note: This instructor DOES NOT ALLOW use of generative AI. 

Students facing allegations of academic misconduct may not drop/withdraw from the affected course unless they are cleared of wrongdoing (see G-9: Academic Integrity). Attempted drops will be prevented or reversed, and students will be expected to complete course work and meet course deadlines. Students who are found responsible for academic integrity violations face academic outcomes, which can be severe, and put themselves at jeopardy for other outcomes which may include ineligibility for Dean’s List, pass/fail elections, and grade forgiveness. Students may also face consequences from their home/major program and/or The Schreyer Honors College.

See also the Penn State academic integrity resources and the academic integrity policy of Penn State Harrisburg.

Penn State welcomes students with disabilities into the University’s educational programs. Penn State values diversity and inclusion; we are committed to a climate of mutual respect and full participation. Our goal is to create environments that are usable, equitable, inclusive, and welcoming. Every Penn State campus has a Student Disability Resources (SDR) office. SDR at Penn State Harrisburg is located in the Student Enrichment Center (SEC) Suite 205.

To receive consideration for academic accommodations, auxiliary aids, and/or services, please contact SDR. SDR will engage students in an individualized, interactive, and confidential process to review requests on a case-by-case basis.

COUNSELING & PSYCHOLOGICAL SERVICES  

Success in college depends heavily on your personal health and wellbeing. Please recognize that some stress and anxiety is an expected part of life and the college experience, which can be compounded by unexpected setbacks or life changes outside the classroom. Penn State Harrisburg has a number of support options listed in this syllabus. 

If you are experiencing issues that feel unmanageable, you reach the point that you have difficulty concentrating and/or feeling motivated, or experience anxiety or depression that interferes with your ability to take care of yourself or your daily responsibilities, please consider talking with someone in our CAPS (Counseling and Psychological Services) office. CAPS provides a range of services to help you navigate issues that are impacting your ability to be healthy, well, and productive at college.

EDUCATIONAL EQUITY  

Penn State takes great pride in fostering a diverse and inclusive environment for students, faculty, and staff.  Acts of intolerance, discrimination, harassment, and/or incivility due to age, ancestry, color, disability, gender, national origin, race, religious belief, sexual orientation, or veteran status are not tolerated and can be reported through the Educational Equity at the Report Bias site: https://equity.psu.edu/reportbias. Penn State’s Code of Conduct can be found on the Student Affairs Student Code of Conduct website.

MANDATED REPORTING

Penn State is committed to equal access to programs, facilities, admission, and employment for all persons. It is the policy of the University to maintain an environment free of harassment and free of discrimination against any person because of age, race, color, ancestry, national origin, religion, creed, service in the uniformed services (as defined in state and federal law), veteran status, sex, sexual orientation, marital or family status, pregnancy, pregnancy-related conditions, or physical or mental disability, gender, perceived gender, gender identity, gender expression, genetic information or political ideas. Discriminatory conduct and harassment, as well as sexual misconduct and relationship violence, violates the dignity of individuals, impedes the realization of the University’s educational mission, and will not be tolerated. Gender-based and sexual harassment, including sexual violence, are forms of gender discrimination in that they deny or limit an individual's ability to participate in or benefit from University programs or activities. For reporting resources, and support, please visit Penn State's Title IX website.

Penn State strongly encourages all members of the campus community to take appropriate action by providing support and encouraging those impacted by such incidents to submit a report to Student Advocacy, Dr. Kelly Weaber or Aimee Wheeler (information below). You may also submit a report online by using the Incident Report Form found here: Office of Sexual Misconduct Prevention & Response Incident Report Form.
