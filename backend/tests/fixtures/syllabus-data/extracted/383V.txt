Description: The field of Quantum Electro-Optics (or Nanophotonics) encompasses the set of
devices, structures, and materials whose electronic and optical properties cannot be understood
using the bulk properties of the constituent materials, but instead depend strongly on both size and
geometry. Nanophotonics is an emerging contemporary area of research with a wide range of new
applications. Understanding the optical properties of nanometer scale structures of semiconductors,
metals, and composites will be crucial for future optoelectronic devices and technology designed to
couple with, complement, or possibly even replace, present and future nanoelectronic devices.
Separated from any electronic components, nano-scale or subwavelength photonic structures offer
new possibilities for sensing, imaging, waveguiding, and many other applications. This course will
examine the quantum mechanical interaction between light and semiconductors, metals, and
composites; including cavity electrodynamics, polarition cavity condensation, sub-wavelength
structures, metamaterials, plasmonics, and applications of the above. Presentations by students are
included to develop oral communication skills as well as to incorporate leading-edge research into
the course.
Prerequisites: Some exposure to quantum mechanics, semiconductor physics and devices.

Grading: Homework/Attend. 30%/5% Due ~1 week after assigned
Midterm Exam 35% In class
Final Project 30% Presentation & questions

Presentation: Each student will give an in-class presentation focused on a cutting-edge research
topic in quantum electro-optics or, alternatively, a numerical program (developed by the student)
used for advanced simulation or calculation of a quantum electro-optical phenomenon.
Presentations will be 15 minutes long, including 2-3 minutes for questions following the
presentation. Presentations will be graded on technical content, oral communication and visual
presentation skills, critical thinking, as well as the presenter’s ability to answer questions and discuss
the presentation topic and its place in the larger context of the field. It is expected that the
presentation (or program) will focus critically on a sub-field outside of the students’ current field
of research.
Course Administration
Lectures: Lecture will consist of ppt slides as well as whiteboard/ppt annotations made during the
lecture. The basic ppt slides will be posted online on Canvas, but for detailed notes or annotations
to the slides, students are expected to attend lecture. Though there will not be an attendance roll
call, in a small class such as this participation and attendance throughout the semester will be noted.
Attendance will account for 5% of the final grade. If a student misses a lecture for any reason, they
will be expected to use the on-line notes to bring themselves up to speed. They may also ask
classmates to share notes taken in lecture.
The classroom will be enabled with automatic recording technology. This means that lectures will
be recorded and automatically posted to Canvas. This will all occur automatically and there is no
guarantee that it will work for every lecture. The best way to ensure you are able to view the lectures
is to attend in person.
Homework: Homework will be turned in before class on the day that they are due. In response to
previous classes’ feedback, I have tried to reduce the total number of HW assignments, giving
students more time for each assignment. In general, the HW will cover topics covered in the lectures
up to and including the Wednesday lecture before the Monday (or Wednesday) of the HW due date.
I have Office Hours on Wednesday (in person) and Thursday (Zoom) to provide any help you might
need. All homework assignments will be posted to Canvas and their due dates listed on Canvas.
No late homework will be accepted. In extreme circumstances, with a letter from Health Services
and/or the appropriate administrative official, a homework can be dropped, but only with course
instructor approval.
Homework will primarily be a mix of analytical, conceptual, and numerical problems. Students
may work in groups to understand the homework problems and to work out approaches to solving
them. However, the homework turned in should represent the individual student’s own work, and
cannot be copied from another student. Copied/reproduced homework constitutes a violation of the
honor code, and will be treated as such.
Analytical Problems: Solutions must be legible, and must indicate the approach taken to solve the
problem, as well as each step used in the approach. It is the students’ responsibility to make clear
to the grader how the problem was solved and what the solution to the problem is. Illegible, or
poorly annotated/described solutions will receive no credit. For clearly presented, well thought-out
solutions, partial credit will be granted even if the solution is not correct.
Conceptual Problems: Conceptual problems will ask for the student to explain in words and/or
equations, a physical phenomenon or concept from the course. Answers are expected to be in clear

and concise English, and free from grammatical and typographical errors. Students are expected to
use their own words, but are free to cite from the literature, as long as all references are clearly
noted. Students may also be asked to respond to questions regarding state-of-the-art concepts or
research, which will require use of the literature.
Numerical problems: Numerical problems are to be performed in Matlab. You should have free
access to Matlab through the University. For those of you not familiar with Matlab, do not despair!
Initial numerical problems will be mathematically and conceptually simply and will give you a
chance to understand the basic operation and functioning of the software. Later numerical problems
will be more complex, both conceptually and mathematically. All numerical homework programs
(*.m files) will be turned in electronically on Canvas. Outputs (plots, graphs, tables, etc.) should be
clearly labeled and turned with the written HW. A basic example Matlab program is available on
the course Canvas website. This program calculates the normal incidence reflection from a
dielectric surface as a function of wavelength and plots the results. Your program files should be
named using the problem name and your initials (i.e. “DW_Reflection.m”). The first two lines of
the script should have the HW, problem name, your full name, your UT EID, and a brief description
of the program, as shown in the example script. All numerical homework problems should be
clearly and concisely annotated. The grader should be able to clearly see the program inputs (and
should be able to change these) and should be able to press the execute button and see the program
outputs.
The analytical and conceptual problems will be handed in as hard-copies, with outputs from the
numerical problems, clearly labelled, attached to the conceptual/analytical solutions. The code
associated with the numerical components will uploaded to Canvas.
Exams: There will be one midterm exam for this course. There used to be two midterm exams, but
previous feedback indicating that i) the course workload was high and ii) that homework seemed to
be the most valuable part of the class led me to try removing an exam. The midterm exam will be
given at approximately the mid-point of the semester, after we have covered the foundational
material necessary for understanding Nanophotonics. The exam will be in class, and will cover all
of the course material up to the date of the exam. Make-up exams will not be given.
Course Learning Outcomes:
This is mandated by our State Legislature. Interestingly, there are exactly 0 members of our state
legislature that understand quantum mechanics, optics, quantum optics, semiconductor band
structure, or pretty much any other topic we will cover. I would be willing to place a rather large
bet that the percentage of State Legislators that can perform a simple integral is in the single digits.
Nevertheless, students should come away from this course with:
- A conceptual and quantitative understanding of light, and the various different ways we can
describe and analyze optical signals and modes.
- A conceptual and quantitative understanding of matter, specifically semiconductors, metals,
dielectrics, and 2D materials. Understanding of band structure, distribution statistics,
density of states, and charge transport.
- Conceptual and quantitative understanding of light-matter interaction, from simple classical
‘toy’ models all the way to second quantization.
- Current cutting-edge topics in Nanophotonics and Quantum Electro-Optics
- The ability to set up and run simple numerical approaches to understand and simulate
fundamental topics in Quantum electro-Optics.
