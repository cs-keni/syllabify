Course Goals:
This class is designed to introduce students to major areas in the study of communication. We are
all "lay" experts in communication. By the end of the course students will recognize differences
between vernacular and academic approaches to communication, and will be able to apply theories
of perception, the self, culture, language, nonverbal communication, mediated communication,
relationships, groups, organizations, and mass communication to real life situations. This class is a
hands-on, active learning experience. Prepare to be involved.
Required Materials:
Text: Ruben, B. D. & Stewart, L. P. (2020). Communication and Human Behavior.
7th Edition. Dubuque, IA: Kendall-Hunt Publishing Co., ISBN: 9781524976958
Prerequisites
None
Course Objectives:
1) to expose students to the concepts and best practices that cut across every aspect of modern
communication,
2) to prepare students to excel in advanced classes within the Department of Communication Arts
and Sciences, and
3) to help non-CAS majors incorporate essential communication principles into their own fields of
study and future professions.
Students from every major or college are welcome. Your grade will be determined by quizzes, exam
performance, in-class discussion, and one major group project. In addition to learning from the
instructor and from your classmates, you will explore practical applications of the ideas we cover in
class.

Course Website:
Canvas will be a central resource for information and you will be expected to check it regularly. The
instructor will be using Canvas to inform you of your grades, collect assignments, and make
available course materials.
ASSIGNMENTS AND GRADING PROCEDURES
3 Exams (300 Points, 100 each; 40% of total course grade)
On three occasions this semester you will have 50 minutes to complete an exam during the assigned
class period (and 2 hours for the final exam, per university requirements). The first two exams will
take place during the semester and the third exam will be during finals week. I will inform you of
the appropriate date and time when the registrar assigns a final exam period for the last exam.
The exams are NOT cumulative; each will cover only the material that we have read or discussed in
class since the last exam. The average of all three exams will constitute your grade for this portion
of the course.
These exams will involve multiple choice and true/false questions. The quizzes that you take
throughout the semester will feature similar questions, so think of the quizzes as important
preparation for the exams.
Documentary Film, Group Exercise (150 Points; 20% of total grade)
Everyone will choose or be assigned a team that will research, script, record, and post-edit a short
documentary film about a specific theory or idea we cover in class. The 7- to 10-minute film that
you create will be screened in front of the class during week 15. Since we want to view a
maximum of five videos per class period, please keep your video between the 7-10 minute
mark.
By the third week of class, you will can choose (or be assigned) to a group and given a production
role based on your skills, interests, and experience. The amount of students per team will be based
on the amount of students we have in our class (no more than 10 teams total). It will be your team’s
2

responsibility to focus on an aspect of communication theory that the instructor helps your team
identify. Your video will include interviews with at least one faculty expert, comments or
testimonials from students, and some scripted/fictional dialogue. The documentary cannot be just a
recording of a conversation between friends or a small group, though everyday conversation can be
a part of the project.
I will provide further instructions for this assignment and a detailed schedule of the relevant tasks
once the teams are decided (made as homework assignments throughout the course that contribute
to the final grade, as noted below). If you do not have access to video equipment, you will have the
opportunity to use equipment from the library’s MediaTech services
(http://www.libraries.psu.edu/psul/mtss.html). In addition, the folks at the Media Commons
(http://mediacommons.psu.edu/students) can provide you with expertise and planning strategies.
Homework (130 Points; 20% of total grade)
Your team will be given homework assignments throughout the semester. These are TEAM assignments,
which mean they are team grades. However, if a team member does not contribute to a homework
assignment please do not put their name on the homework assignment.
Quizzes (40 Points; 5% of total grade)
Four quizzes will be given in class throughout the semester. These quizzes will be OPEN NOTE, but not
OPEN BOOK or OPEN POWERPOINTS. You will want to consistently attend class and take notes during
the lectures to not to miss out on the points from quizzes. Quizzes will also help you prepare for the exams.
Attendance (100 Points; 15% of total grade)
Even though we are a large-format course, participation is highly encouraged. Active participation
necessitates your sharing of insights and your efforts to extend your own and others’ learning through
mature academic behavior. Because we are a large format course and some students may feel intimidated
participating in this environment, attendance will be taken EVERY DAY and will be part of your grade.
Please be considerate of others and their opinions so we can all enjoy a dynamic, engaging, and comfortable
environment. Cell phone use during class in particular and other disruptive behavior will negatively impact
the class. Your absence will be noted and it will negatively impact your grade. If you know you have to miss
a class or are able to provide a documented reason for absences, please contact me as soon as possible.
Students who come to class once a week and/or miss three classes in a row without an explanation or
excuse will find it very difficult to receive a final grade of B or better if you do not attend class regularly.
Grading policy:
Students must complete all assignments in order to pass the class. It is expected that all assignments will be
turned in on time. Please do not miss class in order to finish an assignment!
If you have a particular goal for your grade in this class, please notify the instructor at the beginning
of the semester. This will enable us to work together to assist you in attaining your goal.
Grading Criteria:
100-94 – A
93-90 – A-
89-87 – B+
86-84 – B
83-80 – B-
79-76 – C+
75-70 – C
69-60 – D
Below 60 – F

All grades are final. Please do not ask to have your grade changed for reasons other than mathematical
error. If you have a question about a particular grade you must contact the instructor within 1 week after
the results for that item are posted. Applying subjective standards after the fact invalidates the standards
applied to the entire class and is unfair to every student.
ACADEMIC INTEGRITY
Academic integrity is the pursuit of scholarly activity in an open, honest, and responsible
manner. Academic integrity is a basic guiding principle for all academic activity at The
Pennsylvania State University, and all members of the University community are expected
to act in accordance with this principle.
According to Penn State policy G-9: Academic Integrity, an academic integrity violation is
“an intentional, unintentional, or attempted violation of course or assessment policies to
gain an academic advantage or to advantage or disadvantage another student
academically.” Unless your instructor tells you otherwise, you must complete all course
work entirely on your own, using only sources that have been permitted by your instructor,
and you may not assist other students with papers, quizzes, exams, or other assessments. If
your instructor allows you to use ideas, images, or word phrases created by another person
(e.g., from Course Hero or Chegg) or by generative technology, such as ChatGPT, you must
identify their source. You may not submit false or fabricated information, use the same
academic work for credit in multiple courses, or share instructional content. Please be
aware that Turnitin may be utilized as a plagiarism detection tool in this course. Students
with questions about academic integrity should ask their instructor before submitting
work.
Students facing allegations of academic misconduct may not drop/withdraw from
the affected course unless they are cleared of wrongdoing (see G-9: Academic Integrity).
Attempted drops will be prevented or reversed, and students will be expected to complete
course work and meet course deadlines. Students who are found responsible for academic
integrity violations face academic outcomes, which can be severe, and put themselves at
jeopardy for other outcomes which may include ineligibility for Dean’s List, pass/fail
elections, and grade forgiveness. Students may also face consequences from their
home/major program and/or The Schreyer Honors College.

https://integrity.psu.edu/academic-integrity and the academic integrity policy of Penn
State Harrisburg: http://harrisburg.psu.edu/academics/academic-guidelines-and-policies.
DISABILITY ACCESS
Penn State welcomes students with disabilities into the University’s educational programs.
Penn State values diversity and inclusion; we are committed to a climate of mutual respect
and full participation. Our goal is to create environments that are usable, equitable,
inclusive, and welcoming. Every Penn State campus has a Student Disability Resources
(SDR) office. SDR at Penn State Harrisburg is located in the Student Enrichment Center
(SEC) Suite 205.
To receive consideration for academic accommodations, auxiliary aids, and/or services,
please contact SDR. SDR will engage students in an individualized, interactive, and
4

confidential process to review requests on a case-by-case basis. For more information,
please visit the SDR website.
Please contact the SDR Office at Penn State Harrisburg if you have any questions or would
like to discuss accommodations. You can call 717-948-6025, email hbgsdr@psu.edu, or
visit the office Monday to Friday between the hours of 8 a.m. and 5 p.m.
COUNSELING & PSYCHOLOGICAL SERVICES
Success in college depends heavily on your personal health and wellbeing. Please
recognize that some stress and anxiety is an expected part of life and the college
experience, which can be compounded by unexpected setbacks or life changes outside the
classroom. Penn State Harrisburg has a number of support options listed in this syllabus.
If you are experiencing issues that feel unmanageable, you reach the point that you have
difficulty concentrating and/or feeling motivated, or experience anxiety or depression that
interferes with your ability to take care of yourself or your daily responsibilities, please
consider talking with someone in our CAPS (Counseling and Psychological Services) office.
CAPS provides a range of services to help you navigate issues that are impacting your
ability to be healthy, well, and productive at college.
You can learn more about the confidential mental health services available on campus at
CAPS by visiting the Counseling and Psychological Services website or by calling (717) 948-
6025 Monday through Friday 8am to 5pm. CAPS is located on the 2nd floor of the Student
Enrichment Center (SEC), in Suite 205.
You can speak to an available counselor 24/7/365 any time by calling 1-877-229-6400 or

EDUCATIONAL EQUITY
Penn State takes great pride in fostering a diverse and inclusive environment for students,
faculty, and staff. Acts of intolerance, discrimination, harassment, and/or incivility due to
age, ancestry, color, disability, gender, national origin, race, religious belief, sexual
orientation, or veteran status are not tolerated and can be reported through Educational
Equity at the Report Bias site: https://equity.psu.edu/reportbias. Penn State’s Code of
Conduct can be found at the following link: https://studentaffairs.psu.edu/support-safety-
conduct/student-conduct/code-conduct.
Direct all inquiries regarding the nondiscrimination policy to Student Diversity, Equity, and
Inclusion at 717-948-6180.
MANDATED REPORTING
Penn State is committed to equal access to programs, facilities, admission, and employment
for all persons. It is the policy of the University to maintain an environment free of
harassment and free of discrimination against any person because of age, race, color,
ancestry, national origin, religion, creed, service in the uniformed services (as defined in
state and federal law), veteran status, sex, sexual orientation, marital or family status,
pregnancy, pregnancy-related conditions, or physical or mental disability, gender,
perceived gender, gender identity, gender expression, genetic information or political
5

ideas. Discriminatory conduct and harassment, as well as sexual misconduct and
relationship violence, violates the dignity of individuals, impedes the realization of the
University’s educational mission, and will not be tolerated. Gender-based and sexual
harassment, including sexual violence, are forms of gender discrimination in that they deny
or limit an individual's ability to participate in or benefit from University programs or
activities. For reporting resources, and support, please visit Penn State's Title IX website.
Penn State strongly encourages all members of the campus community to take appropriate
action by providing support and encouraging those impacted by such incidents to submit a
report to Student Advocacy, Dr. Kelly Weaber or Aimee Wheeler (information below). You
may also submit a report online by using the Incident Report Form found here: Office of
Sexual Misconduct Prevention & Response Incident Report Form. If the University Title IX
staff receives information about an incident, they will reach out to offer information about
resources, rights, and procedural options available to you.

State's Virus Info website.
Student Attendance Policy
Class attendance and evaluation of student performance are to occur in accordance with
Academic Administrative Policy E-11. As indicated in this policy, “Class attendance is a
critical element of student success and one of the most important ways students learn and
understand course materials. Students may need to miss a class meeting to participate in a
regularly scheduled university-approved curricular or extracurricular activity or due to
unavoidable or other legitimate circumstances (including participation in local, state, and
federal governmental elections and religious observances).”
In relation to missing an exam or other evaluative event in class, the policy states, “When
an absence or other circumstance covered in such policies results in a student being unable
to complete an evaluative event that contributes to the final grade, the student or their
representative is expected to inform their instructor, who is expected to provide the
student, within reason, the opportunity to complete missed evaluative events. The
instructor may require use of the class absence form. Even if the absence meets the
expectations of University policies listed above, in some situations, making up missed
classes or missed evaluative events may not be possible.”
Additional information regarding missed classes and exams can be located in Academic
Administrative Policy E-11: Class Attendance and Evaluation of Student Performance.
A strong correlation between attendance and course grades has been found. You are
responsible for all lecture material and/or assignment details given during a missed class.
SEEQ and MSEEQ
During the semester you will receive information for completing the Midsemester Student
Educational Experience Questionnaire (MSEEQ) and, later in the semester, information for
completing the Student Educational Experience Questionnaire (SEEQ). You will receive this
information via your Penn State email and Canvas Notifications. Both the MSEEQ and the
9

SEEQ are an opportunity for you to provide me with anonymous feedback regarding your
learning experience in this course. Your feedback is important because it helps me to
understand your experience in this course and it provides me with helpful information to
improve the learning experience for future students. I welcome and appreciate the
anonymous feedback that you provide.
Student-Initiated Recording of Class
According to University Policy AD40, Recording of Classroom Activities and Note-Taking
Services, students must obtain the express permission of the faculty member responsible
for instruction in the course to record class sessions. Screenshots showing instructors and
students are considered recordings. Authorized student-initiated recordings must be used
only for the education of the students enrolled in the initiating student’s class during the
period in which the student is enrolled in the class. In addition to the requirements in the
preceding paragraph, an authorized student-initiated recording must not be made available
to anyone outside of the students enrolled in the class in any manner, including posting
online or through other media without the express written consent of the faculty member
responsible for the course or the cognizant University administrator.
Weather Cancellations
In the event of weather-related problems, check the PSH web site or local radio and TV stations for
class delay or cancellation.
Additional courtesies
It can be difficult to concentrate on the topic at hand, and participate in discussions, if you are
distracted by outside communication (phone calls, texting or computer use). If there is a situation
that requires you to have a cell phone active during class—such as work or family emergencies—
please speak to me in advance. Otherwise, electronic equipment should be turned off and out of
sight.
