FIN 374C: VALUATION
SYLLABUS
PROFESSOR SURY
Unique: 03490 | Spring 2019 T, Th | 3:30 – 5:00pm | GSB 2.122
Welcome to Valuation! This course is a rigorous exploration of the practice of valuation within the
discipline of corporate finance. It is primarily focused upon the evaluation and financing of major
investments, acquisitions, and capital expenditures that companies may face. The theory behind these
decisions will be explored, but practical issues involving the application of the concepts will be emphasized,
with case studies covering scenario analysis, simulation, and the appropriate use of managerial discretion.
We will cover a number of current strategies, methods, and techniques used by leading corporate financiers.
This course section is slanted towards those with an interest in investment banking and consulting (strategic
finance). To that end, this section incorporates some “real-world” casework that will touch upon valuation
techniques for cost of capital, financing alternatives, and merger and acquisitions (M&A) applications.
Key questions that will be addressed include:
(cid:1) What are the relevant cash flows of an investment?
(cid:1) What are the risks involved with an investment, and how might a firm mitigate these risks?
(cid:1) How can an investment be financed, and how much does financing contribute to its value?
(cid:1) How does an investment affect the firm’s financial statements?
(cid:1) How will an investment impact the firm’s earnings per share (EPS)?
(cid:1) Is there flexibility in the way that a project can be implemented, and if so, how does the flexibility
contribute to value?
(cid:1) If an investment is delayed, will the opportunity still be available in the future?
(cid:1) Does an investment exploit the firm’s existing comparative advantages, and does it create new
comparative advantages that will generate valuable projects in the future?
This syllabus is subject to modification.
Prerequisite: FIN 357 or FIN 357H. Students should be comfortable with financial statements, accounting
identities, and statistics (including random variables and distributions). Working knowledge of Excel is
assumed.

It is important to note that—unlike some introductory finance courses—the practice of valuation is both an
art and a science. In fact, some may argue that it is neither: rather, it should be considered a craft. Initially
some students experience frustration with the inability to rely solely upon memorized formulas or
predetermined steps that work in all cases. Indeed, some scenarios may have more than one “correct”
approach—and more than one potential solution. Good solutions depend upon a number of factors,
including: a logical and well-reasoned approach, the correct use of techniques appropriate to the approach,
the accuracy of the attendant calculations, and a thoughtful narrative that ties the “story” together.
As students accumulate experience in valuation, they often find that the “art” of valuation frees them to
incorporate a certain level of (appropriate) creativity and innovation in their methods. Indeed it is precisely
this creativity and innovation that can enable the best financiers to stand out.
Grading
Course performance will be evaluated according to the following schedule:
Homework, 5 x 4% each: 20%
Case Analyses (teams), 3 x 10% each: 30%
Midterm: 20%
Final Exam: 30%
TOTAL 100%
HBS Cases: Cases are obtained by accessing the HBS Course-Pak at http://hbsp.harvard.edu. Cases are to
be completed by working in self-selected teams of 4 students that will remain together for all cases during
the semester.
One of the best ways to learn about valuation is by doing valuation. Cases provide you with the opportunity
to exercise practical applications of the techniques and strategies that are taught in lecture and in the
textbook. Navigating through cases can take some getting used to, but the pride you will get from struggling
with—and ultimately tackling—these real-world situations can be extremely satisfying.

for support sooner rather than later is often helpful.
If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or
depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support.
