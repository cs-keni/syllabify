REVIEW SESSIONS
During an exam week, there will be no regular discussions. Instead, the TA will conduct
ONE evening review session for ALL students. Times and locations are listed below.
ADD/DROP
The last date to add or drop a course is Friday, September 14, 2012.
COURSE PREREQUISITES
Credit with a grade of at least C- or co-enrollment for one of the following: SC 302, M
305G, M 408C, M 408D, M 408K, M408L, M 408M, M 408 N; and an appropriate score
on the ALEKS chemistry placement examination.
QUANTITATIVE REASONING FLAG
This course carries the Quantitative Reasoning flag. Quantitative Reasoning courses are
designed to equip you with skills that are necessary for understanding the types of
quantitative arguments you will regularly encounter in your adult and professional life.
You should therefore expect a substantial portion of your grade to come from your use of
quantitative skills.

TEXTBOOK
Please feel free to purchase any old edition general chemistry or chemical principles
textbook and save a lot of money! Of course, an e-book is also an option, if you prefer,
but it is not cheap. This will be discussed further in class.
QUEST (required)
This course makes use of the web-based Quest content delivery and homework server
system maintained by the College of Natural Sciences. This homework service will
require a $25 charge per student for its use, which goes toward the maintenance and
operation of the resource. Please go to http://quest.cns.utexas.edu to log in to the Quest
system for this class. After the 12th day of class, when you log into Quest you will be
asked to pay via credit card on a secure payment site. You have the option to wait up to 30
days to pay while still continuing to use Quest for your assignments. If you are taking
more than one course using Quest, you will not be charged more than $50/semester. For
payment questions, email quest.fees@cns.utexas.edu.
READING ASSIGNMENTS
For reading assignments, we will be referring to topics that will be easy to find in any
textbook. A daily tentative lectures schedule is posted at the end of the syllabus.
HOMEWORK (OPTIONAL, for bonus points)
There will be approximately 10 homework assignments for you to complete for the
session. Homework assignments will absolutely not be accepted after the deadline that is
posted on the homework assignment. Homework must be turned in (submitted) via the
web before the deadline in order to receive any credit. We will add 10% of the raw score
earned on the homework assignments turned in before an exam to this exam raw score. A
late homework will not be graded and a score of zero will be recorded.
HOW DO YOU GET YOUR HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT?
We will be using the College of Natural Sciences server, QUEST (details above). The
URL is the following: http://quest.cns.utexas.edu/student/.
More info on quest is posted on blackboard under course documents.
ICLICKER
We will be using the iclicker for in class pop/attendance quizzes. Either version of the
iclciker will work for the course. In order to get credit for your pop quizzes, your iclicker
has to be registered.
HOW DO YOU REGISTER YOUR ICLICKER?
BLACKBOARD REGISTRATAION WILL NOT WORK FOR THIS COURSE!
All iclickers need to be registered by Wednesday, September 5th. Please go to the
following site and follow the instructions: http://www.iclicker.com/registration/

GRADING FOR THE COURSE
The grades for the course will be determined as follows:
Quizzes/Attendance 100 points possible
Hour exam total Best 3 of 4 exams, 200 points each 600 points possible
Final exam 300 points 300 points possible
1000 points total
The total scores will be considered to assign letter grades for the course using the
following scale:
920 – 1000 A, 900 – 919 A-, 880 – 899 B+, 820 – 879 B, 800 – 819 B-, 780 – 799 C+, 720
– 779 C, 700 – 719 C-, 600 – 699 D, 599 and less F.
THERE WILL BE NO CURVE OR ADJUSTMENT ON EXAMS. HOWEVER, an
outstanding final will affect grades that are close to the announced cutoffs.
DETAILS OF THE GRADING
1. Quizzes: Quizzes will be given any time during lecture period on Mondays (unless
otherwise announced in class). The material covered on each quiz will be derived from
the reading assignments and the lecture material since the “last quiz”. At the end of the
semester, you will be allowed to drop the lowest two quiz scores and your quiz total
will be adjusted to reflect a possible total of 100 points. Because you will be allowed
to drop the two lowest quiz scores, there will be no make-up for missing quizzes.
No early quizzes will be given, either. Quizzes will be given at the scheduled
times only. If you miss a quiz, for any reason, a score of zero will be assigned for
that quiz.
2. Attendance: You are required to attend the lectures and your weekly discussion
sessions. A missed discussion session will result in a “zero” score for that week’s
quiz. With legitimate excuse, you will be allowed to miss two discussion sessions
throughout the semester with no penalty. You are expected to be on time for the
discussions. A student who is more than five minutes late will count as tardy. Two
tardies will count as an absence. A student who comes more than 10 minutes late will
count as absent. Attendance/pop quizzes may be given during lecture at any time.
Any points you earn on such quizzes will be considered bonus points to be added to
your total points at the end of the semester.
3. Hour Exams: There will be four evening exams. Each of the exams will cover one
portion of the course to be announced in class. Each exam will last one hour and a half
and will be machine graded on a scale of 200 points. If you are not exempt from the
final, the best three exam scores will be used in calculating your grade. Because one
exam will be dropped, no makeup exams will be given except for a documented
and really compelling reason. A reason to take the exam at a different time is
deemed compelling at the discretion of the instructor of the course. A score of
zero will be recorded for any exam that is missed for any reason. The exam dates
are online on the course schedule and listed in this syllabus as well. Therefore, you
should be able to plan ahead for possible conflicts. In the case of a possible conflict,
please email both the instructor of the course and the TA at least two weeks ahead of
the exam time.

4. Final Exam Exemption: If you average 190/200 or above on the four in-class exams
and if your quiz average is 80% or above, you will be exempt from the final and you
will be awarded an A for the course.
5. Final Exam: The final exam will be comprehensive, covering the entire material of
the course, and will be machine graded on a scale of 300 points.
6. For students in CH 108 (51645): Everything in this syllabus applies to you just like
any other CH 301 student. However, CH 108 is a pass/fail class. Passing CH 108 will
depend on attendance. CH 108 meets on M (4:00 – 5:00) in WEL 3.502.
