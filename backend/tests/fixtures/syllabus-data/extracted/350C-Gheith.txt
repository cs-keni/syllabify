Objective
Help you develop a deeper understanding of high performance processor
architecture (software view) and micro-architecture (internal organization).
In order to achieve that we will:
* review the fundamentals of digital design and introduce you to the Verilog
hardware design language
* use that knowledge to design a simple processor
* iterate over our architecture and micro-architecture in order to enhance its
performance; learning about:
* RISC vs. CISC
* Pipelining
* Superscalar
* Out-of-order
* Branch-prediction
* Caches
The bulk of the work will be done in simulation but you’ll also have the
opportunity to synthesize your design on an FPGA board and see it run if
you’re interested.
Evaluation

* 2 in-class exams: 40% (Thursday 3/12, Thursday 5/7)
* Design milestones (~ 12): 50%
* Class participation: 10%
Grade cutoff guidance: A-/A >= 90%, B-/B/B+ >= 80%, C-/C/C+ >= 70%,
D-/D/D+ >= 60%
Project submission
Projects will be assigned, tracked, and submitted using a system based on
the GIT revision control system. I will teach you enough git basics to get
you going but you’re encouraged to learn about git if you’re not already
familiar with it. Here are some online links:

Late policy
All assignments are due at 11:59pm central time on the due date. An
assignment is considered submitted once it has been pushed to your git
repository on the server.
Late assignments will be graded for 50% of the maximum score. You have
till the last day of class to submit late assignments.
Textbook
David Harris and Sarah Harris, “Digital Design and Computer
Architecture” (Second Edition).
Originality of submitted work: you are required to cite any sources you used in
your work (discussions with colleagues, articles, open source projects, google
search results, etc). All violations or your inability to explain your work will raise a
red flag and will be viewed as suspected plagiarism.

Ask lots of questions and have lots of conversations: Lectures are more
useful when they’re interactive. I encourage you to ask questions and ask for
clarifications but please refrain from side conversations. One conversation at a
time.
