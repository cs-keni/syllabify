Student-Centered Approach
In this course, we will discover and discuss a number of controversial topics. These
topics intend to spark discussions and the exchange of ideas and knowledge.
Therefore, the course is designed to enhance your understanding of issues related to
business and society by giving you an opportunity to share your knowledge and
experiences with others. In this learning process, I encourage you to continuously
communicate with your classmates. Your active participation in this course is very
important. Textbook and readings materials will serve as an important tool for your
course preparation. Some suggestions for the course are:
● Be enthusiastic and maintain a positive attitude
● Maintain respect and class decorum during online discussions
● Emphasize quality over quantity of materials you will be presenting
● Be creative, analytical, and innovative in case analyses and other
assignments
● Back opinions and coherent arguments
● Utilize the suggested readings
In accordance with Penn State University requirements and expectations this is a
"writing emphasis" class.
Academic Integrity

Academic integrity is the pursuit of scholarly activity in an open, honest, and responsible
manner. Academic integrity is a basic guiding principle for all academic activity at The
Pennsylvania State University, and all members of the University community are
expected to act in accordance with this principle.
According to Penn State policy G-9: Academic Integrity,
Links to an external site.
an academic integrity violation is “an intentional, unintentional, or attempted violation of
course or assessment policies to gain an academic advantage or to advantage or
disadvantage another student academically.” Unless your instructor tells you otherwise,
you must complete all course work entirely on your own, using only sources that have
been permitted by your instructor, and you may not assist other students with papers,
quizzes, exams, or other assessments. If your instructor allows you to use ideas,
images, or word phrases created by another person (e.g., from Course Hero or Chegg)
or by generative technology, such as ChatGPT, you must identify their source. You may
not submit false or fabricated information, use the same academic work for credit in
multiple courses, or share instructional content. Please be aware that Turnitin
Links to an external site.
may be utilized as a plagiarism detection tool in this course. Students with questions
about academic integrity should ask their instructor before submitting work.
Students facing allegations of academic misconduct may not drop/withdraw from
the affected course unless they are cleared of wrongdoing (see G-9: Academic
Integrity
Links to an external site.
). Attempted drops will be prevented or reversed, and students will be expected to
complete course work and meet course deadlines. Students who are found responsible
for academic integrity violations face academic outcomes, which can be severe, and put
themselves at jeopardy for other outcomes which may include ineligibility for Dean’s
List, pass/fail elections, and grade forgiveness. Students may also face consequences
from their home/major program and/or The Schreyer Honors College.
