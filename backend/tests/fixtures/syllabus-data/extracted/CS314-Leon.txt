Overall Goal
To significantly improve programming and debugging skills by developing a deep understanding around every line of code that we read or write.

This course is aligned with CS 205 System Programming and Architecture at the Oregon University System (OUS) level.

Acquired Skills
Upon successful completion of the course, students will have acquired the following essential skills:

be able to use bitwise operations to efficiently solve problems in C.
be able to write iterative and recursive algorithms in C and assembly language.
be able to debug C code using gdb, debug assembly code using an interactive assembler/debugger.
be able to optimize C code with respect to instruction counts, unpredictable branches, and memory-access patterns.
be able to implement a basic direct-mapped caching solution.
Course Objectives

Estimated Student Workload
Each student will:

read assigned readings in the required textbook;
attend the live lectures;
attend a weekly lab session, led by one of the graduate teaching assistants, at which you will be introduced to tools and techniques to help you be proficient in developing your projects;
submit solutions for 8 programming projects - these are individual efforts, and must represent your own work;
sit and submit the midterm and the final.
Workload expectations are 12 hours per week.

Grading Policies
Grading will be based on the following criteria:

10%

Attendance quizzes (in person) - on Canvas - can not be made up - lowest 5 scores dropped - individual submission -  collaboration encouraged

15%

Labs - submitted to Canvas - late policy applies (attendance code dropped 5 days after last lab of the week) - lowest score dropped - individual submission - collaboration encouraged

25%

Assignments - submitted to Canvas - late policy applies - lowest score dropped - individual submission - collaboration and peer review encouraged

25%

Midterm exam - in person - individual submission - individual work only - page of notes (only) allowed

25%

Final exam - in person - individual submission - individual work only - 2 pages of notes (only) allowed

It is the sole responsibility of the student to verify that submissions have been successfully uploaded prior to the due date. To verify a submission, revisit the submission page for the assignment to view your uploaded files.

Grading Criteria
A

Excellent performance. Very well prepared to continue on in the major. Solid grasp of the concepts and approaches introduced in CS 314

B

Solid performance. You have shown a generally good grasp of the concepts and approaches introduced in CS 314.

C

Acceptable performance, but your grasp of the concepts and approaches will require improvement if you choose to continue in the CS major.

D

Your grasp of concepts and approaches, and/or programming skills, are not yet sufficient to continue in the CS major.

F

Little or no demonstrated grasp of concepts and approaches introduced in CS 314, and/or failure to carry out much of the required work.

Grading Scale
  A  	 A+ >= 97.00*	 A 93.00 - 96.99 	 A- 90.00 - 92.99

*Eligibility for 'A+' grades will be based on exam scores; only students with exam scores in the top 5% of the course will be considered.

Absences
In-class lecture attendance will be tracked via attendance quizzes (lowest 5 scores dropped).  Absences will only be excused in accordance with the University Course Attendance and Engagement policy.  Accommodations for prolonged absences may be arranged with the Accessible Education Center (AEC).

Late Work
Assignments and labs will be automatically penalized 10% of the maximum score for each day after the Canvas due date, up to a maximum penalty of 50%.  For assignments, a 24-hour grace period will be extended between the posted due date and the Canvas due date.  Late penalties will only be waived in accordance with the University Course Attendance and Engagement policy.  Accommodations for flexibility on assignment deadlines may be arranged with the Accessible Education Center (AEC).  Late submissions will not be accepted after the final exam.

As stated above, it is the sole responsibility of the student to verify that submissions have been successfully uploaded prior to the due date.  Incomplete submissions, for any reason, will be subject to the late penalty.

Missed Exams
Exams can only be rescheduled in accordance with the University Course Attendance and Engagement policy or with respect to Accessible Education Center (AEC) accommodations.

It is against university policy to administer final exams before the posted date/time.

AI Policy
Students may use GenAI tools in this class to help with course work and assignments. Helpful uses include brainstorming ideas, creating outlines, editing, and so forth.  Although open use of GenAI is allowed in this class, be advised that GenAI suggestions or content can be inaccurate, incomplete or otherwise problematic; using GenAI can impact negatively the quality of your work and your grades.

Classroom Community Expectations
All members of the class (both students and instructor) can expect to:

Participate and Contribute:  All students are expected to participate by sharing ideas and contributing to the learning environment. This entails preparing, following instructions, and engaging respectfully and thoughtfully with others.   While all students should participate, participation is not just talking, and a range of participation activities support learning. Participation might look like speaking aloud in the full class and in small groups as well as submitting questions prior to class or engaging with the message board.  We will establish more specific participation guidelines and criteria for contributions in our first weeks of the term.

Expect and Respect Diversity: All classes at the University of Oregon welcome and respect diverse experiences, perspectives, and approaches. What is not welcome are behaviors or contributions that undermine, demean, or marginalize others based on race, ethnicity, gender, sex, age, sexual orientation, religion, ability, or socioeconomic status. We will value differences and communicate disagreements with respect. We may establish more specific guidelines and protocols to ensure inclusion and equity for all members of our learning community.

Help Everyone Learn: Part of how we learn together is by learning from one another. To do this effectively, we need to be patient with each other, identify ways we can assist others, and be open-minded to receiving help and feedback from others. Don’t hesitate to contact me to ask for assistance or offer suggestions that might help us learn better.
