Description:
The application of ethical theory to medical practice is an important part of modern medicine
and public policy. We look at several approaches to ethics and several areas of medicine to gain
insights into medical ethics. This course carries the ethics and leadership flag. Consequently, a
substantial portion of the grade will involve ethical issues and reasoning.
