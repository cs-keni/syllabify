Course content and goals
Ecology is the scientific study of the relationships between living organisms and their environment, including their
relationships with other living organisms. The primary goal of this course is to provide you with an introduction to all of
the major areas in the field of ecology. Fundamental concepts, central questions, and essential knowledge of each area will
be emphasized.
To encourage your interest in ecology and your participation in class, I do not plan to give lengthy lectures. Instead, we
will use lecture time to review important concepts from the textbook and to read and discuss articles and papers.
Discussion sessions will be conducted by your teaching assistant (TA). Your TA will guide the class in discussing articles,
reviewing major concepts, and preparing for exams. Each student is required to prepare for, attend, and participate in both
lecture and discussion.
Assigned Readings: Over the course of the semester, I will assign chapters from the textbook and additional reading
material (articles, papers, websites, etc.). Additional reading material will either be provided in class or posted on
Blackboard. You are required to read the assigned reading before class and bring the textbook and/or reading to lecture.
Textbook: Ricklefs, R. E. The Economy of Nature. Freeman & Co., New York., 6th Edition

Grading
Exams (150 points possible)
There will be four exams on the dates shown below. Each exam will be worth 50 points. Students will not be able to make
up an exam, but we will drop the lowest score. Exams will be a mixture of matching, fill-in-the-blank, short answer and
short essay questions. If you believe that there has been a grading error, you must meet with us to talk about your concerns
within ONE WEEK of receiving your graded exam.
Homework (60 points)
There will be four homework assignments worth 15 points each. Late homework will NOT be accepted. The homework
assignments will be posted on Blackboard (Homework One will be posted on 1/25/11).
Participation (40 points)
We will record attendance and participation at each lecture (see grading rubric at end of syllabus).
Quizzes (50 points possible)
There will be six „pop‟ quizzes during discussion. Each quiz will be worth 10 points. Students will not be able to make up
a quiz, but we will drop the lowest score.
This gives a total of 300 possible points. The course grade will be computed by dividing the sum of all points earned by 3.0
to obtain a final score based upon a 100 point scale. No extra credit opportunities will be offered. I will use the
plus/minus grading system. In this course your final course grade will be one of the following: 93-100 points =
A, 90-92 points = A-, 87-89 points = B+, 83-86 points = B, 80-82 points = B-, 77-79 points = C+, 73-76 points =
C, 70-72 points = C-, 60-69 points = D, below 60 points = F.
Policy on scholastic dishonesty: Students who violate University rules on scholastic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary
penalties, including the possibility of failure in the course and/or dismissal from the university. Policies on scholastic
dishonesty will be strictly enforced.
Students with disabilities: If you require additional support or special test-taking conditions, please let us know and
bring a letter of documentation from the Disabilities Office (SSB 4.100, 471-6259) in plenty of time for special
arrangements to be made. If you are allowed extra testing time, you may be taking your exams at the SSD office. It is your
responsibility to download the “Scheduling an Exam/Test Form” from:
http://www.utexas.edu/diversity/ddce/ssd/forms_docs.php and to see that this form is completed and delivered to SSD.
Accommodations for religious holidays: As per university policy, accommodations will be made for religious holidays.
The student must make the instructor aware in writing of a religious-related absence by February 4, 2011.
Classroom rules
Students are encouraged to use computers in lectures or discussion sessions- INA PRODUCTIVE MANNER. That means
you should not use Facebook or Twitter, visit unrelated web sites, send text messages/emails, etc.
While this is a biology class, not a class in ethics, policy, or economics, some of the material we will be discussing has such
aspects. Differing opinions on such topics as prevention of animal cruelty versus preservation of endangered species are
welcomed, and no student will be graded (up or down) on his or her opinion on such matters.

Participation Rubric
Students will be randomly divided into groups of 3-4 individuals (15-20 groups total in lecture). During lecture, you will
work with your group to complete handouts and activities, to discuss the assigned readings and homework, and to present
information to the class. You will be graded as follows:
Attendance in lecture (apart from excused absences) = 10 points possible
Absent 0-1time = 10 points
Absent 2 times = 9
Absent 3 times = 8
Absent 4 times = 7
Absent 5 times = 6
Absent 6 or more times = 0
Lecture Group grade = 30 points possible
Each Lecture Group will receive a grade. All members of a Lecture Group will receive the same grade. This is an
example of positive „peer pressure‟! During lecture, we will work with each group and make note of the group’s
engagement as well as the quality of your group’s work. Is the group on-task (i.e., talking about Yellowstone or American
Idol)? Does the group produce well-developed answers to the handouts and activities? Lecture Groups should feel free to
ask for feedback on their performance throughout the course of the semester. We will be happy to provide tips to
improve your group‟s performance.
Each Lecture Group will be graded as follows:
27-30 = always well prepared (book/reading always present and completed), fully engaged, high quality work
24-26 = well-prepared (book/reading almost always present and completed), mostly engaged, above average work
21-24 = average preparedness (book/reading usually present and completed), somewhat engaged, average work
18-20 = not prepared (forget to bring and read book/reading), disengaged, below-average work
