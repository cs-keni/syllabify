BIOLOGY 365S: Vertebrate Systems Physiology (Unique# 50655-50670)
Spring 2011 Syllabus
Instructor: Dr. Jan Machart (rhymes with Lockhart). PAI 3.10D. 471-6985. 897-9851 (cell)
janmachart@mail.utexas.edu Office hours: TBA weekly (see Blackboard)
Lecture: RLM 4.102 10-10:50 am MWF
COURSE OVERVIEW: This course primarily covers cellular, cardiovascular, respiratory, renal,
gastrointestinal, and endocrine physiology. Nerve and muscle physiology will be discussed briefly and
primarily as pertains to the rest of the course. The emphasis is on human physiology, with pathophysiological
examples brought in to contrast with normal functioning.
This class is as much about learning techniques and critical thinking as it is about physiology. We will use an
active-learning approach that requires you to understand and synthesize the material as well as memorize it.
You will learn how to integrate material to make a body of knowledge that you can use to solve problems
and to answer questions that you have not studied previously. We cover a vast amount of material, and you
must have both the background and the academic maturity to deal with it. You will be responsible for reading
the text assignments and for taking the assigned Mastering A&P quiz (see below) before coming to class.
We will quickly review the basic material that you have read, but will focus some class time on applying the
information.
Regular class attendance and active participation are essential for this type of approach. The wireless (CPS)
system is a great way of checking attendance, encouraging participation, and determining if the class ―gets‖
the concept in question. Collaboration is also encouraged; you will be allowed to work together on most
wireless questions and homework assignments.
The exams will reflect the problem solving and synthesis approach. Exams will include information that has
not been covered directly but that you should be able to answer based on the material from lecture
TEXTBOOKS: Required: Human Physiology: An Integrated Approach, 5th edition (Silverthorn, 2010).
Note: I am in the process of ―overhauling‖ the study guide, which I have always required in past semesters.
I will be posting the study guide (per unit) to Blackboard.
Recommended (especially for students who have not taken 365R or 416K): the student workbook that
goes with the text . The workbook contains guided note taking to accompany the assigned reading, class
exercises, and study questions/problems.
SUPPLY LIST: REQUIRED: Gen 2 RF or Gen 3 RF handheld remote for use with the wireless class
performance system or CPS. (UT Coop ~ $20; $13 registration fee; simple calculator ( – 5 pts for use of
alphanumeric on exams); optional (but recommended)—binder with dividers
EXAMS & GRADING: There will be four exams during the semester, all scheduled during the regular
lecture hour. Check the lecture schedule for exam rooms. Each exam is cumulative, so you are responsible
for any material covered in the semester up to that point. Exams are teaching tools as well as evaluation
tools, so a significant portion of the test will emphasize application of content and will require problem-
solving skills.

There will be two options for computing your final grade:
Option I Option II
Exams 1-4 60% 40%
CPS/Quizzes/Homework 10% 10%
Mastering A&P quizzes 10% 10%
Comprehensive final 20% 40%
Each student must take the final exam in order to receive a grade in the course. The final exam will be
divided into sections corresponding to exam 1-4 material. If you score higher on a section than you did on
the corresponding exam, you may replace your exam grade with that score. Students who have an
EXCUSED absence for an exam (see below) will replace their missing exam grade with their grade from
that portion of the final. Students who simply fail to show for an exam will take a zero on that exam. Also,
students who “take” an exam but leave pages blank will take a zero for that exam. Dr. Machart will make
the ultimate decision as to whether you can replace an exam grade.
You must have a NON-ALPHANUMERIC calculator for the exam. Accommodations will be made for
qualified students with disabilities. For information about University provisions, contact the Office of the
Dean of Students at 471-6259, 471-4641 TTY.
Grades will be assigned, based on a 10 point scale and the plus/minus system. Thus:
89.5 – 92.5 = A- , 93+ = A
79.5-82.5 = B-, 83-86 = B, 86.5-89.4 = B+
69.5-72.5 = C-, 73-76 = C, 76.5 -79.4 = C+
59.5 -62.5 = D-, 63 – 66 = D, 66.5 – 69.4 = D+ < 59.5 = F
REGRADE REQUESTS must be submitted to the instructor or TA no later than one week after the test is
returned. This includes questions about addition/subtraction errors, so it is in your best interest to check the
arithmetic as soon as a test is returned. If you wish to contest the grading of an answer, you must submit a
WRITTEN REQUEST with an explanation of why you believe your answer deserves more credit. For
content re-grades, the ENTIRE EXAM will be re-graded, so you run the risk of losing points. The exam will
not be re-graded if there is any sign of alteration of answers. Tests written in pencil will not be re-graded if
there is any sign of erasure. Tests with ―white-out‖ will not be re-graded. The keys for the tests will be
posted.
MISSED EXAMS: A missed exam will be excused only if:
1) The student can produce a verifiable, written medical excuse OR there has been a verifiable death in the
immediate family
2) AND the student has contacted the instructor PRIOR to the exam. Upon failure to contact the instructor
personally, you may email or leave a voice mail message. You MUST contact the instructor PRIOR to the
first class meeting after the missed exam, or you will receive a ZERO for the exam. Missing the exam
because of confusion regarding date and place is NO EXCUSE.
MASTERING A&P ASSIGNMENTS: Detailed information on these assignments is posted to
Blackboard. You should read the textbook assignment, then take the pertinent online quiz. You will be
expected to be familiar with the information covered BEFORE coming to class.
HOMEWORK & QUIZZES: There will be 3-4 additional homework assignments and several quizzes.
The due dates for the homework are given in the schedule. Your composite CPS (wireless) score will
constitute another quiz/homework grade.

DISCUSSION SESSIONS: Meet in various rooms (see below) beginning Mon 24 Jan. The TA will assist
you in further problem solving. The baroreceptor computer lab discussion will be held in PAI 3.12.
Discussion exercises will not be graded but are critical for modeling the problem-solving approach. You
must have permission from Dr. Machart to attend a discussion section for which you are not registered.
M 8-9 a PAR 206 M 9-10 a PAR 306
Tu 8-9a JES A218A Th 9-10 a JES A207A
PLUS study groups: Pre-selected and prepared students known as preceptors will lead weekly study groups
in specific worksheets designed to help with homework or exams. A senior preceptor from a previous
semester and I will team up to prepare the preceptors, so that they can be effective. If you are unable to
attend, the worksheet and key will be posted to Blackboard.
ACADEMIC DISHONESTY: Academic dishonesty (cheating) will not be tolerated in any form. This
includes (but is not limited to) cheating on exams and quizzes, altering tests after they have been returned,
and failing to cite references or plagiarizing from references used in the case studies. Please read the section
on academic integrity, published by the Dean of Students:
http://www.utexas.edu/depts/dos/sjs/academicintegrity.html
The following policies apply for all tests and quizzes:
1) No talking except to instructors.
2) Eyes on your own paper, or on the ceiling if you need to look away to think.
3) Backpacks, coats, hats, etc., must be placed at front of room. Purses, cell phones and pagers may be kept
underneath your seat. Cell phones and pagers should be turned off.
4) No alphanumeric calculators ever, and no calculator at all if not required for exam.
5) One empty seat between each student
6) No one will leave the room without an escort unless exam is finished.
CLASS BLACKBOARD SITE: Assignments, exam hints, exam keys, and other information will be
posted on the class Blackboard site, which you can find by going to your courses on your UT Direct page or
by going to http://courses.utexas.edu.
WIRELESS SYSTEM: Gen 2 RF remotes can be purchased from the Co-op for $20. Enrollment
instructions are posted to Blackboard. The cost to enroll is $13. It is your responsibility to resolve all issues
involving the remotes. For enrollment problems or for technical support, contact eInstruction customer
support.
It is also your responsibility to bring the remotes to class. You are allowed 3 missed cps sessions. If you
forgot your remote, you can hand in a card with your name and the date. If you have an excused absence,
you can email for attendance credit. All wireless questions will be graded at 90 % credit. That is, if you
answer correctly, you receive 100% credit; answer incorrectly—you still receive 90% credit.
Drop date:
The last day to Q drop the course except for urgent non- academic reasons is Monday, March 28, 2011.
After this, students may go to the Dean’s office, WCH 2.112, to appeal for non-academic reasons.
Religious Holy Days
It is the policy of The University of Texas at Austin that the student must notify the instructor at least
fourteen days prior to a scheduled class day that s/he will be absent to observe a religious holy day. For
religious holidays that fall within the first two weeks of the semester, the notice should be given on the first
day of the semester. For the purposes of grading in this course, such days will qualify as excused absences.
