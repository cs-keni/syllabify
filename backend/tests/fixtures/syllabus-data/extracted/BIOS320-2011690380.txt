Course objectives
The objective of this course is to provide an overview of cell structure and
function at the molecular level and discuss specific cellular processes including
cell communication, cell cycle, programmed cell death, and cancer. The course
will focus on developing an understanding of the nature and function of a large
number of proteins and methods used for their analyses.
Course organization
The course is divided into 3 parts, and upon completion of each part there will be
an exam.
Discussion meetings
Every student is expected to attend and participate in the discussion sessions.
Students should bring questions from the lecture, or any relevant material that
they may have come across in their readings, to these meetings and use these
for discussion with other students. Apart from student questions, a work sheet
will be posted on Blackboard for every discussion session and students will work
on the questions provided in the work sheet in groups of 3-4 students each.

Answers to these questions should come from a discussion within the group and
where necessary the TA will help in guiding the students to the correct answer. It
is expected that in these meetings students will learn to analyze problems before
attempting to work on them. In many cases these skills are best acquired by
watching other students work on the given problems. Discussion meetings will
also be used for discussion of assigned research articles. Attendance in the
discussion meetings will account for 6.25% of the final grade (25 points).
Attendance
No attendance will be taken during the lecture meetings. Attendance will be
taken for the discussion meetings and will count for a maximum of 25 points (of a
total of 400 points at the end of the semester).
Examinations
Three exams and 3 quizzes will be conducted during the lecture period this
semester. The maximum time given will be 1 hour, 15 minutes for the exams
and 20 minutes for the quizzes. All the exams and quizzes will be used in
determining the final grade. There will be no final exam during the final exam
period.
Each exam will cover only the material that has been covered in class before the
exam date as listed in the syllabus. Material covered in an exam will not be
included in the subsequent exam(s). Quizzes will include only the material
covered in the previous two lectures. Exams and quizzes will have short-answer
questions, problems, multiple choice questions, fill-in-the blanks, mix-and-match,
and figures. A sample exam will be posted on Blackboard.
Make-up examination will be given only if a student is unable to take any one of
the first two exams, and is able to provide a valid reason and documentation for
absence from the exam. The make-up examination will include material from the
first two exams and it will be given before the last class day. No make-up will be
given for a missed quiz.
Breakdown of points Total points 400 percent of total points
Exam 1 100 points 25%
Exam 2 100 points 25%
Exam 3 100 points 25%
3 quizzes (25 points each) 75 points 18.75%
Discussion attendance 25 points 6.25%
Grading system
The Plus/Minus grading system will be followed based on the number of points
scored out of 400.
Grade Percent ___________
A 93% and above
A- 90% to <93%
B+ 86% to <90%

A few words about the lecture and discussion meetings
A lecture class or a discussion session is a group activity and to make the most
of this activity, consider the following points:
Every student has the right to learn as well as the responsibility not to deprive
others of their right to learn. Every student is accountable for his or her actions.
In order for you to get the most out of this course, please consider the following:
a. Attend all scheduled classes and discussion sessions and arrive on time.
b. Please do not schedule other engagements during the class or discussion
time.
c. If you have trouble hearing the lecture or media presentation because of
distractions around you, quietly ask those responsible for the distraction to
stop.
d. Please let me know immediately if you have any problem which is preventing
you from performing satisfactorily in this class.
Feedback
Feedback is an important part of any learning. During this course I will be asking
you to give me feedback on your learning in informal as well as formal ways such
as assignments or exams. Please let me know when something we discuss is
not clear. It will enable me to provide additional information when needed or to
explain a concept in different terms.
