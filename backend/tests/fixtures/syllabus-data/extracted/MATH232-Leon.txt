Course Description
ThiscoursebuildsonthefoundationalmathematicalideasfromMath231,whichincludedlogic,
languageofsetsandfunctions,mathematicalproofsandsomebasicnumbertheoryrelatedtothe
Euclidean Algorithm. In Math 232, we will consolidate these ideas and add also the important
method of proof by induction and the idea of recursive definitions. These go hand-in hand with
recursive algorithms which are common in computer programming. Math 232 also develops im-
portant new concepts and tools, including linear recurrence relations, some of the combinatorial
mathematics arising from graphs and trees, and optimization algorithms involving networks of
various sorts.
Textbook
Rosen, Discrete Mathematics and Applications, 7th or 8th edition. This course will cover some
parts of the Chapters 5, 8, 10, 11. (For details on topics covered, see below).
Calculators
A scientific calculator will save you time doing simple computations. You will only be allowed
to use one of the following calculators on quizzes and exams: Casio fx-260, Casio fx-300MS (or
Plus), Casio fx-300ES (or Plus), TI-30X (a, S, or IIS), TI-34.

Assessments
1. Classwork(15%): There will be problem/discuss session in the second half of each lecture
(except Fridays). You will work on a problem set based on the lecture. You can discuss it
with your peers and/or me, but you will need to write up the solutions on your own and
hand them in by the end of lecture. Grading on classwork is based on completion rather
than correctness, meaning you’ll get full credit if you complete (probably some of) it.
2. Written homework (15%): There will be weekly written homework, due on Fridays at
11:59am.
3. Quizzes(20%): There will be quizzes which take place in the second half of the lecture on
Fridays in weeks 1,2 and 3. Your best two will count toward your grade. (i.e. it’s OK if you
do bad or miss one of them.)
4. Final exam(50%): Of course, there will be a final exam on Friday in week 4.
