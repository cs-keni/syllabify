1.2 Prerequisites
Finance367isaRestrictedCourseforstudentswhoarecurrentlyenrolledinamajorprogram
in the College of Business and Administration. Note that several prerequisites apply for
this course and are published in the Course Schedule. Prior completion of Finance 357
or Finance 357 H, Statistics 371G or Statistics 371 H are among these requirements. In
addition, proficiency in mathematics and spreadsheet packages is assumed. Students who
are uncertain as to whether they satisfy these requirements should notify the instructor.
1.3 Course Materials
(cid:136)
Lecture Notes: these are the main course text and material to prepare for your
exams. Lecture notes will be handed out at the beginning of each class day. These
handouts will include all the formulas you need to solve problems, as well as a broad
overview of the material we discuss in class. You will need to attend and take your
own notes during class for many important discussions and topics not on the handouts
but that also comprise material covered in the exams.
(cid:136)
Calculator. Any calculator capable of power and logarithm operations is acceptable
(in the unlikely case that you don’t already have a calculator, the TI-30XS is cheap and
more than capable for our needs). You will need to use the calculator in the exams, so
you cannot replaced it with your phone or computer. Please bring your calculator to
class every day.
(cid:136)
Textbook: Investments by Zvi Bodie, Alex Kane, and Alan Marcus, 10th or 9th
Editions. This textbook is a valuable additional reference for the material we teach
in the course. However, exam and homework questions will be more closely related
to lecture notes and discussions. Because of that, and because this textbook is so
expensive, there is no need to purchase the latest edition (i.e., the 11th Edition). We
will not use Connect or any other electronic service offered by the textbook’s editor.
1.4 Grading
You can collect up to 100 points in this course as follows:
1. Three Exams (25 points each).
2. Mutual Fund Management Game (10 points).
3. Homeworks (10 points).
2

4. Participation (5 points).
1.4.1 Exams
(cid:136)
The three exams given during the semester will carry equal weight toward your fi-
nal grade. Exams will be noncumulative. The tests will include both qualitative and
quantitative material. The qualitative questions are usually short answer or multiple
choices. The exams will cover topics from the lecture notes, class discussions, assign-
ments, and, to a lesser extent, assigned readings from the textbook. Needless to say:

the semester.
(cid:136)
No makeup examinations will be given without the prior consent of the instructor.
Such consent will only be given for demonstrable conflicts and with the proper docu-
mentation.
(cid:136)
You lowest score among the first two exams will be dropped from your final exam grade
computation only if this raises your final total score. Your total exam score (up to the
75 points) will be calculated as the maximum of:
Option 1: E1+E2+E3 (i.e., total score if no exam score is dropped)
Option 2: 75(E2+E3) (i.e., total score if first exam score is dropped)
50
Option 3: 75(E1+E3) (i.e., total score if second exam score is dropped)
50
where E1, E2, and E3 represent your scores in the first, second, and third exam scores
(up to 25 points), respectively.
1.4.2 Homeworks
(cid:136)
Homeworks are due before class a week after they are made available. You can either
give me your assignment just before lecture or you can take it to the Finance depart-
ment reception (CBA 6.222). If you chose the latter, make sure to time stamp it (as
evidence that you in fact met the deadline), and ask one of our assistants to place it
in our mailboxes. Keep in mind that the Finance department is only open from 8am
until 5pm (weekdays).
(cid:136)
Students must submit their assignment solutions individually. However, we encourage
you to discuss and work on the assignments with your classmates.
(cid:136)
If you get stuck on any problem, do not hesitate to come to our office hours for help.
In total, our TAs and the instructor in charge of the course half offer at all times 6
different options of hours of office hours per week to make sure that at least one suits
you. Make sure to take advantage of this resource!

points). The final assignment score will only take into account your highest 8 scores.
Some assignments might be mandatory (i.e., the associated score cannot be dropped
from your final assignment score). We will announce this beforehand. Your total
assignment grade will be calculated as the average of the highest 8 homework scores x
10 The multiplication by 10 is just a rescaling to make sure that the maximum total
100 100
assignment score is 10 points.
1.4.3 Mutual Fund Management Game
(cid:136)
This is a group project in which you will work in the design, marketing, and manage-
ment of a mutual fund family.
(cid:136)
I will randomly assign students to groups in the first few weeks of the course.
(cid:136)
More information about the the game, including the timeline of events and grading
scheme will be provided during the first few weeks.
1.4.4 Participation
The participation grade is meant to improve the quality of our interactions and class-
room atmosphere. Being respectful and having a professional attitude towards your
classmates, TAs, and instructor, as well as fully abiding by UT’s Honor Code is all you
need to earn your full 5 participation points.
1.5 Course Policy
Fairness to Students: We strive to treat students with dignity and fairness. This does not
mean that we will always agree with your ideas. If you feel that we have been unfair in any
way, please let us know. We know that sometimes it takes courage to do so.
Teaching Notes: Lecture notes will be posted on Canvas after class, but homework solutions
will NOT be posted, emailed, or distributed in any other electronic form. You can only
collect hard copy of homework solutions in class before lectures. If you miss a class, please
go to the instructor’s office hours to get a hard copy of the homework solutions.
4

Grading: There are no verbal appeals of grade changes. Exams will not be returned and can
be reviewed only during TA office hours during the two weeks following the reception of the
grade. You should submit a written statement explaining the problem within one week of
receiving your grade and we will be happy to re-grade any exam or assignment. The entire
exam or case will be re-graded and the score may increase, remain the same, or decrease.
Academic Honesty: We take academic honesty very seriously. We expect you to adhere to
The McCombs Code of Ethics and to comply with collaboration restrictions noted in the
syllabus and on assignments throughout the semester.

2.3 Policy on Scholastic Dishonesty
The McCombs School of Business has no tolerance for acts of scholastic dishonesty. The re-
sponsibilities of both students and faculty with regard to scholastic dishonesty are described
in detail in the BBA Programs Statement on Scholastic Dishonesty at
www.mccombs.utexas.edu/BBA/Code-of-Ethics.aspx. Byteachingthiscourse,wehaveagreed
to observe all faculty responsibilities described in that document. By enrolling in this class,
5

you have agreed to observe all student responsibilities described in that document. If the
application of the Statement on Scholastic Dishonesty to this class or its assignments is un-
clear in any way, it is your responsibility to ask me for clarification. Students who violate
University rules on scholastic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary penalties, including the
possibility of failure in the course and/or dismissal from the University. Since dishonesty
harms the individual, all students, the integrity of the University, and the value of our aca-
demic brand, policies on scholastic dishonesty will be strictly enforced. You should refer to

University policies and procedures on scholastic dishonesty as well as further elaboration on
