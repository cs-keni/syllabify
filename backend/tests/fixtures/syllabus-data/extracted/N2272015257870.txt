Assessment Activity: Clinical assessments are performed to diagnose a case or to assess the
effectiveness of care. In this course you will be introduced to several evidence based assessment
tools for a variety of conditions that are pertinent to the care of the geriatric patient. This
assignment will allow you the opportunity to practice choosing an appropriate instrument for an
identified or potential problem, discuss the psychometric properties, strengths and weaknesses of
the instrument, practice using the instrument, interpreting the results, and incorporating the
findings in a nursing care plan. You must choose one assessment tool. Patient must be 65 years
or older. See form for grading criteria.
Self-Study Module--Stroke
The Stroke Module will be posted at the halfway point of the semester. Read the module
available on Canvas and take the Post Test at the end of the module. Submit the Post Test
through Canvas by the date indicated with the assignment. Remember, this assignment is not a
group assignment. Discussion of answers with other students prior to submission of the
Post Test will result in a grade of "0.” If you have questions about the module, please see your
teacher.
COURSE POLICIES
Course Evaluation: Attendance and Participation
Credit toward Attendance and Participation (5% of course grade) is accumulated by being
present at the start of classes, returning promptly from breaks, submitting work on time,
participating in class activities, and responding with keypads to questions or opinion requests
posed during class sessions.
Punctuality
Tardiness is viewed as unprofessional. Students are expected to arrive in class and be ready to
start class at the official class time. In the event of an unavoidable late arrival the student will
enter the class room quietly and sit in an available seat, preferably near the door to avoid
disrupting other students.
Attendance
Regular attendance at all class meetings is expected. If you must be absent for an emergency
please contact your teacher, or leave a message (voice, text through teacher’s cell phone, or
email) prior to class. A student who fails to complete missed work within the time allowed will
be subject to the normal academic penalties.
Religious Holy Days
A student who is absent from a class or examination for the observance of a religious holy day
may complete the work missed within a reasonable time after the absence, if proper notice has
been given. Notice must be given at least fourteen (14) days prior to the classes scheduled on
dates the student will be absent. For religious holy days that fall within the first two weeks of the
semester, notice should be given on the first day of the semester. It must be personally delivered
to the instructor and signed and dated by the instructor, or sent certified mail, return receipt
requested. Special regulations of colleges and schools, required by the unique nature of their

N227 Spring 2015
programs of study, may be enacted through the normal legislative process and printed in The
Undergraduate Catalog. These special regulations may not conflict with University regulations
on class attendance and absence
Student Conduct Policy
Students and faculty in The School of Nursing each have responsibility for maintaining an
appropriate learning environment. Faculty will have the professional responsibility to treat
students with understanding, dignity and respect and to guide the teaching/learning process.
Students are expected to refrain from verbal and nonverbal behaviors in the classroom and
clinical settings that may be distracting to others, such as, but not limited to arriving late or
leaving early, side conversations, text messaging, answering cell phone or pager, note passing,
surfing the internet or answering e-mail on laptops.
Students who persistently engage in behaviors that are disruptive to the teaching/learning process
may be required to leave the setting. For further information refer to General Information,
Institutional Rules on Student Services and Activities, Chapter 11: Student Discipline and
Conduct.
Honor Codes
The profession of nursing has a legacy of public respect and trust. We provide specialized care
for the health needs of individuals and the community with integrity, honesty, compassion, and
state of the art knowledge and skills. Learning and practicing responsible and ethical professional
behavior is a vital part of professional education. The Institutional Rules on Student Services and
Activities given in the General Information Catalog (Chapter 11) and The University of Texas at
Austin’s Honor Code apply to all nursing students:
The core values of The University of Texas at Austin are learning, discovery, freedom,
leadership, individual opportunity, and responsibility. Each member of the University is
expected to uphold these values through integrity, honesty, trust, fairness, and respect
toward peers and community.
Additionally, the School of Nursing has its own honor code:
As a student in The University of Texas at Austin’s School of Nursing, I pledge myself to
be honest in all of my student activities including, but not limited to, all of my scholastic
work and interactions with patients, members of the community, faculty, and peers.
Furthermore, I will not use any substance prior to or during my interaction with patients
that could alter my judgment or ability to render safe care: this includes but is not limited
to any use of alcohol, illegal drugs, and prescription or over-the counter drugs that may
impair my mental and/or physical abilities required to perform safe patient care. I will
disclose to my instructor any violations of the above standards of conduct.

N227 Spring 2015
Examinations
The student is required to attend all exams and to be seated and ready to take the exam at the
start of the scheduled class time. Students are required to turn off or silence all cell phones prior
to the start of the exam. No hats are to be worn during the exam. Students will place all
backpacks against the wall or at the back or sides of the room before the tests are distributed.
There will be no talking which starts when exams are passed out. Students will raise their hands
and ask permission to go the bathroom during exam administration. A group review of test
results and selected test items will usually be held the week following the exam. Within a posted
window of time following each exam, students may make an appointment with the teacher for
individual exam review. Exams cannot be removed from the class room nor the teacher’s
office.
In the event of exceptional circumstances that make it impossible for a student to be present for
a scheduled test, arrangements must be made with the professor in advance. Make-up exams
must be scheduled within one (1) week of the original scheduled exam. Alternate forms of the
examination may be utilized in the make-up exam. If an emergency circumstance arises and the
student will be late or unable to attend, the professor must be notified prior to the scheduled
starting time. If prior arrangements are not made with the professor, the student may not be
permitted to take the test at the discretion of the instructor and a zero will have been earned by
the student and awarded to the student.
Missed/Late Assignments
All students are expected to complete assignments on time. Prior arrangements (at least 1
week in advance of due date) should be made with the professor for late submissions.
Missed assignments without prior notification will be awarded a zero. Points per day
(including weekends) will be deducted for late assignments except for extenuating
circumstances.
Mid-Semester Notice
Students who are averaging a C or below at mid-term will receive a “mid-semester” failing
report from Student Affairs. The purpose of this report is to clearly and openly communicate
with the student regarding their standing in the course. Another purpose is to encourage the
student to seek immediate assistance to strengthen understanding of the course content and
improve ability to apply the course content in the clinical setting and on the exams.
Scholastic Dishonesty Policy and Professional Integrity
Refer to the General Information for information on the Scholastic Dishonesty Policy Sec. 11-
802. Scholastic dishonesty includes but is not limited to cheating, plagiarism, collusion,
falsifying academic records, and misrepresenting facts. The Dean of Students Office records acts
of dishonesty and notifies the School of Nursing of each incident. In addition to all of the
University statements and policies relative to academic dishonesty, the School of Nursing
recognizes the strong link between honesty in academic work and professional integrity. Any act
of academic dishonesty, including fabrication of reports or records of interactions with clients, is
considered incompatible with ethical standards of nursing practice. The School of Nursing does
not admit students who have a record of violations to the professional sequence. Students who

N227 Spring 2015
engage in scholastic dishonesty may be subject to dismissal and may jeopardize their eligibility
for licensure as a registered nurse.
Academic and Program Accommodations for Students with Disabilities
Refer to the General Information for information on Academic and Program Accommodations
for Students with Disabilities or contact the Services for Students with Disabilities office in the
Office of the Dean of Students at 471-6259. The School of Nursing works to ensure that students
who have disabilities have equal access to the University’s programs and services.
If you have any questions about services or accommodations for students with disabilities, please
talk with the faculty member, the Assistant Dean for Undergraduate Programs, or the Assistant
Dean for Student and Clinical Affairs or directly call the Office of the Dean of Students, Services
for Students with Disabilities, 471-6259.

Introduction to Activities in Conjunction with N325 Clinical Coursework
Reminiscence Activity: There will be one activity, Reminiscence, from past Aging coursework
that will be taught and practiced within the N227 Aging course, but that will be submitted as part
of the N325 Junior 1 clinical course. Reminiscence is an activity that can allow clients a sense of
security through rehearsal of comforting memories, belonging through sharing, and self-esteem
through confirmation of uniqueness. The textbook by Ebersole and associates (2008) has a
detailed section with suggestions for intervening on pp. 624-627. These few pages will be posted
on Canvas within the N227 course. However, students will submit their written work within the
N325P clinical course as part of their 3-page Nursing Process clinical form. Your Nursing
Process activities will be organized using Gordon’s Functional Health Patterns. The
Reminiscence section is highlighted within the larger document Nursing Process document. A
copy of the 3-page Nursing Process clinical form is provided under Course Documents for
Aging, Week One, and will also be discussed, and distributed within your clinical course.
Assessment Activities: Clinical assessment is performed to diagnose a problem or identify a
patient strength, or to assess the effectiveness of care. In this course you will be introduced to
several evidence-based assessment tools for a variety of conditions that are pertinent to the care
of the geriatric patient. You will have the opportunity to practice choosing an appropriate
instrument for an identified or potential problem; to discuss the psychometric properties,
strengths and weaknesses of the instrument; practice using the instrument, interpreting the
results, and incorporating the findings in a nursing care plan. While assessment instruments will
be introduced early in the semester in both the Aging course and the Clinical course (N325),
practice with actual patients will take place in in your clinical course.

N227 Spring 2015
Nursing Building Evacuation Plan
If you see smoke, see flames, smell something burning, or become aware of another emergency
that may require evacuation of the building, immediately:
1. If possible, ISOLATE the fire or other emergency by closing the door.
2. ACTIVATE the nearest FIRE ALARM PULL STATION.
3. EVACUATE to the PRIMARY or SECONDARY ASSEMBLY AREA.
4. Dial University Police at 911 or Dispatch 471-4441.
DO NOT CALL 911 UNTIL YOU ARE OUTSIDE THE BUILDING.
IF A FIRE ALARM IS ACTIVATED OR IF YOU HAVE RECEIVED AN EVACUATION
ORDER:
• In a calm and orderly manner, proceed to evacuate the area and follow the instructions of
the Floor Managers or emergency response personnel. Each floor has two designated floor
managers. Their role is to ensure that everyone on their floor has proceeded to the fire exit
stairs. Occupants in areas 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 are to exit the first level of the southwest
stairwell. Occupants in areas 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 are to exit the first level of the northwest
stairwell. See maps that follow these instructions.
• Do not rush, push or panic.
• Close your office, classroom, or lab door behind you.
• EVACUATE to the designated ASSEMBLY AREAS. If your progress to one of the
PRIMARY assembly areas is impeded, proceed to the other PRIMARY assembly area
without either re-entering the building or attempting to move through any obstruction.
During inclement weather, proceed to the SECONDARY assembly area.
• DO NOT USE ELEVATORS TO EVACUATE. Descend the nearest fire exit stairs in single
file down to the GROUND LEVEL (first floor) and exit the building. Primary fire exit stairs
are located on the southwest and northwest ends of the building.
• If there is someone who requires assistance, please escort them to the STAGING AREA.
• Do not reenter the building unless directed by UTPD, an Austin Fire Department Officer in
charge, or Building Manager.
• Faculty are responsible for informing their students and any guests of these procedures. If
for some reason your class should meet in a classroom that is not your assigned classroom,
you should provide evacuation instructions for that location.
Refer to the floor-specific plans to determine your evacuation route and assembly area.
DO NOT BLOCK ACCESS TO BUILDING FOR EMERGENCY PERSONNEL. Do not exit
through the front door of the building unless you are in the lobby areas outside the central
elevators/stairwell or unless access to one of the other stairwells is blocked. If you are in the
courtyard outside the second floor lobby, you may exit through the glass doors to the east or
west, then out to one of the designated assembly areas.
ASSEMBLY AREAS
From NORTHWEST FIRE STAIR EXIT—proceed to first floor stairwell exit door to outside of
building. DO NOT ENTER FIRST FLOOR HALLWAY AND EXIT THROUGH GLASS
DOORS. Primary assembly area is across north bridge toward tennis courts. Secondary assembly
area is Trinity Garage; enter off Lot 23.
From SOUTHWEST FIRE STAIR EXIT— proceed to first floor stairwell exit door to outside of
building. DO NOT ENTER FIRST FLOOR HALLWAY AND EXIT THROUGH GLASS
DOORS. Primary assembly area is south to Centennial Park. Secondary assembly area is Trinity
Garage; enter off Lot 23.
EVACUATION ASSISTANCE

N227 Spring 2015
It is expected that faculty and staff will assist those among us who require assistance in case of
evacuation. If you, or a guest or student, require assistance in emergency situations, please
inform the Building Manager of the type of assistance needed based on the following categories:
• Alarm Notification – occupant has hearing and visual impairments; may be able to easily
navigate stairs but require notification if the alarm has activated. This can be the case if a
person with hearing impairments is working in an office with the door closed.
• Slow Evacuation Capability – occupant can navigate stairs but requires some assistance or
who move at a much slower pace than others.
• Impractical Evacuation Capability – occupants who cannot navigate the exit stairs. To
evacuate the building, this occupant must be carried down or evacuated through an elevator
provided with emergency service.
The names of those provided will be kept in the fire alarm panel for use by emergency
responders.
STAGING AREA
If an occupant needs assistance, please escort them to the area outside the stairwell. If they are
unable to use the stairs, wait until everyone has evacuated the area, move them into the stairwell,
and after evacuating the building, inform your Floor Manager where you have left them.
