All exams count equally towards the final course grade. Individual exams will not be assigned a
letter grade. A single comprehensive make-up exam will be offered only for students who can
provide documentation of illness or other non-academic emergency. Cumulative scores will be
curved to arrive at the final grade. There are no predetermined cut-off points and no
predetermined letter grade quotas. Plus and minus letter grades will be used.
Students with disabilities may request academic accommodations from the Division of Diversity
and Community Engagement, Services for Students with Disabilities, 471-6259. Approval
letters must be provided to an Instructor before the first exam.
