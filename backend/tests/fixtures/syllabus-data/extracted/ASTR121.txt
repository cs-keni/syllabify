Hello and Welcome!
Hello and welcome to ASTR 121! I’m excited for you to join me this term. I grew up in Colorado and
studied Engineering Physics at the Colorado School of Mines, where I began my teaching journey as
an undergraduate teaching assistant. I came to the UO to pursue a PhD in physics, studying optical
materials for solar applications. Along my journey, I found that teaching captured my curiosity more
than my projects in the lab. I’m so grateful to teach you one of my favorite topics: astronomy!
Course Description
ASTR 121 traces our evolving knowledge of the Solar System. We will explore how developments in
technology (naked eye observations, telescopes, robotic space probes) have repeatedly changed our
understanding about what the Solar System contains and how it formed. We will also move beyond our
solar system to see how research on exoplanets (planets around other stars) is reshaping our
understanding of what solar systems can look like. You will learn not only about how the scientific
process works, but also reflect on how science and technology impact society. Finally, you will reflect
on how our knowledge of other worlds can help us to understand and cherish our own.
I do not assume extensive prior knowledge of science or math. We’ll teach you to apply the quantitative
reasoning you’ll need. Your chances of success in this course are high if you ask a lot of questions
starting with "why," "how" and "what if" - because curiosity fuels science.
This course is designated as a Natural Science Core Education course. At UO, Core Education is
designed to provide a broad, interdisciplinary education that helps students think critically and
creatively, communicate clearly, and reflect ethically. In this class, you will practice:
● Critical Thinking through In-Class Activities, Homework, and Think & Explain Questions, and
● Written Communication through Think & Explain Questions and our Project.
ASTR 121, Winter 2024: Syllabus - 1

Course Objectives
By the end of the course, you will be able to…
● Experience science as a process and a skill:
○ Formulate questions based on your curiosity, then build and refine your mental models
(hypotheses) in an iterative process that mirrors the practice of astronomy.
○ Support arguments and draw conclusions by interpreting data, figures, graphs, and
images, and applying physical principles, quantitative reasoning, and logical thinking.
○ Express and reflect upon your mental models during class using various representations
(words, images, diagrams, and even gestures) in order to collaborate in knowledge-
building with your peers (mirroring how scientists learn as a community).
● Build an awareness of astronomy as an evolving discipline:
○ Communicate about astronomy topics in writing or multimedia formats to an audience of
your peers, with care taken to center quality sources of evidence and to craft your
message according to the context, audience, and purpose of your projects.
○ Hone an awareness of open questions in astronomy, which will help you to better
appreciate, analyze, and critique the astronomy you encounter in news media, social
media, and popular culture.
● Build an understanding of Earth as a planet:
○ Describe how humans “read the sky” and use observational evidence to conclude that
the Earth is not at the center of the Solar System.
○ Explain phenomena such as seasons, moon phases, ocean tides, and eclipses.
○ Describe what processes shape Earth’s crust, atmosphere, and climate.
○ Discuss the social, historical, and cultural context and impacts of astronomy.
● Build an understanding of Solar System Science and Exploration:
○ Describe the basic characteristics (size, structure, composition, surface features) and
motions of objects in the solar system.
○ Compare and contrast solar system objects (planets, moons, rings, and more) to
analyze how physical laws and chance encounters guided their development.
○ Describe how the solar system formed and evolved over time.
○ Explain how we find planets around other stars (exoplanets), and summarize the new
findings and questions which have arisen from the burst of research in this field.
○ Discuss our place in space and the prospects for life elsewhere in the Universe.
I’m not a science major. Why should I take an astronomy course?
I think it’s important for students pursuing a variety of goals to learn astronomy, because:
● Astronomy builds skills employers want, including scientific and quantitative reasoning.
● You will learn strategies for independent learning and study that will serve you well in other
classes, and in your journey of lifelong learning.
● Astronomy is part of our history and life. Learning astronomy is inspiring and contributes to a
sense of purpose and belonging in our world - a sense of being an “Earthling.”
Where can I find detailed learning goals that I can use to study?
● In our study guide, lecture slides, and Canvas assignment descriptions.

Andrea’s Teaching Philosophy
Research shows that people learn best through active learning, in which learners are active
participants rather than passive observers. Our course design provides structured learning
opportunities before, during, and after class to help you engage your brain and monitor your own
understanding as you build your knowledge about astronomy.
Each learning opportunity plays a different role, thus they all contribute to your grade, with flexibility
built-in and tailored to each mode. If you find that any element of this course design presents a barrier
to you or that you would benefit from different types of learning opportunities, please let me know.
Learning Opportunities and Assessments
Class Preparation: You are expected to read the daily textbook sections and watch the recommended
videos. While prep is ungraded, class will be most effective for everyone if you are familiar with key
terms before class. A “shallow” read before class and “deep” read after class can be highly productive.
In-Class Activities: We will work together on interactive activities on Canvas during class to guide you
through new ideas, so please bring a device. You have unlimited attempts so that you can learn from
your mistakes. Due after class, but activities never close, so you can practice with them repeatedly.
Focus on understanding and ask lots of questions during class!
Homework: Homework will flex your critical thinking skills and guide you to apply new ideas.
Homework will be challenging. You will have two attempts and should strive to build understanding as
you make mistakes and try again. Please, work together! However, don’t just swap answers: you’ll
learn more if you ask for explanations and explain what you understand to others. I invite you to office
hours to find study partners, ask questions, and get some coaching.
Due Mondays at midnight, grace period through Tuesday at noon; deadline is firm because feedback
(correct answers and occasional video explainers) will be delivered just after the grace period. I will
offer makeup homeworks approximately every two weeks, and your lowest score will be dropped.
Collaborative Quizzes: Short quizzes will help you calibrate your understanding. You will have two
attempts; only the highest score will count toward your grade. Attempt one is to be done before class,
on your own. You will be able to see your score, but not which questions you got right or wrong. For
attempt two, you will have the chance to discuss your thinking with others in class (this process mirrors
the practice of science). We will review quizzes in class immediately after they are due.
Quizzes are open-book and open-note, but you should strive to attempt quizzes without these aids to
maximize your learning. You have an opportunity to retake quizzes within one week. Retakes will be
modified slightly, and you will have only one attempt.
Think & Explain Questions:
We will ask you to explain your reasoning on selected topics via a written or video explanation. You
may work together to craft your explanations, but the work you submit should be your own (and you
should cite any sources you use). About 3 of these will be dropped, out of 8 or 9 total offerings.
ASTR 121, Winter 2024: Syllabus - 3

Weekly Reflections: You’ll reflect on your learning, how you’re doing overall, and how we conduct the
course. This is your chance to give me feedback - use it! Due Mondays at midnight.
Study Guide: Our study guide (on Canvas) will include effective study practices, learning goals, and
links to weekly study guides, which you can use to guide your reading or to study throughout the term. I
will coach you on effective study techniques after our first quiz,
Project: You will create two short projects to explore your curiosity and demonstrate your learning
expressively. You can work solo, or in groups of 2-4, and will have an opportunity for peer review
before grading occurs. Due during weeks 5 and 10. Topics include:
● Scientist Spotlight: Learn more about astronomers past and present.
● AstroBites: Summarize new research results in astronomy. I will keep a forum open where I
will share relevant recent astronomy discoveries relevant to our weekly topics. You’re also
invited to also post astronomy you find in the news each week! If you’re interested in a project
analyzing real-life data as an alternative to the AstroBites assignment, let me know by the end
of week 5.
Final Exam: The final exam covers everything in the course. It will be done individually and proctored
in class during our university-scheduled final exam time. If you miss the final due to an emergency or
illness, you must request an incomplete grade and schedule a makeup exam next term. Absolutely no
early exams will be permitted for any reason. Making travel plans without consulting the final exam
schedule does not constitute an emergency. Please put the final on your calendar now!
Final exam questions will be in a format similar to homework and quiz questions. You will be expected
to apply ideas in some novel (and fun) ways, but mostly the final will test your understanding of core
concepts. You should strive to be as prepared as possible for a final exam that asks you to think
critically, analyze evidence, and apply your conceptual understanding.
You’re allowed an 8.5 x 11 inch reference sheet with information on both front and back sides for the
final exam. After each quiz, I will invite you to share your reference sheet for that unit for extra credit.
The final exam weighting has been carefully considered to contribute a meaningful amount to your final
grade, but avoiding the unnecessary stress of a truly high-stakes final. The final exam is unlikely to
raise or lower your grade by more than a letter grade, but it is likely to lower or raise your grade by an
amount dependent on how your final exam score compares to your pre-final grade. This can catch
students off guard, because if you enter the final with a 90%, you might expect to ace the final as well.
However, remember that you have multiple attempts for almost all assignments except for the final. So,
the best way to earn your goal grade in the class is to engage completely in all learning opportunities,
ask lots of questions, and reality-check your understanding of our learning goals regularly throughout
the term (strategies for this are described in the study guide).
Extra Credit
I offer extra credit opportunities throughout the term. Each one will be worth 0.5%. I will offer more than
4 opportunities, but your total extra credit cannot exceed a total of 2% (though you’re welcome to
complete additional opportunities just because you find them useful!). I cannot offer individuals any
opportunities that I do not offer to everyone, and I will not offer any extra credit after the final exam.

Time estimate: The total out-of-class time is about 8-12 hours per week (the time above, plus about 2-
4 hours per week of individual or group study, possibly in the Drop-In Help Center, in Price Science
Commons B010). Study wisely: spread out your study time and use the study guide (on Canvas).
Grade scale: A: 90%, B: 80%, C: 70%, D: 60%. I use plus/minus: plus for grades ending in 7, 8, or 9
and minus for grades ending in 0, 1, and 2. I round all final grades up to the nearest whole number.
Since zero grades are mathematically unfair, I give a grade of 50% for missing work, with the exception
of the project and final exam.
Curving: I do not curve course grades, because curving can drive an unhealthy competitive culture,
while in our classroom, we value collaboration and growth. It is also unnecessary, because I believe
each of you is capable of succeeding within this course structure. Sometimes I will curve final grades by
a small amount if the final exam questions do not probe your understanding in the way I intended.
Historically, this has resulted in about a 1-2% increase on the final grade, but this is not guaranteed.
ASTR 121, Winter 2024: Syllabus - 5

Course Policies and Classroom Expectations
Classroom Expectations for Participation
This class involves a high level of interaction during class to harness the power of learning together. All
students are expected to participate by sharing ideas (even when they might be wrong!) and listening
as others share theirs. I understand that our class can spark exciting conversations; however, for the
sake of maintaining a quality learning environment for others, please stop your conversations at my
signal. I recognize that some students may not be comfortable with interactivity (for instance,
neurodivergent students or students who are learning English). I encourage you to find ways to
participate in class that are comfortable for you, but also to take risks and expand your comfort zone!
Respect for Diversity
You should expect to be welcomed, included, treated with respect, and supported by me and your
peers. Students of all racial identities, ethnicities, genders, gender identities, gender expressions,
national origins, religious affiliations, sexual orientations, citizenship statuses, ability and other visible
and non-visible differences belong in and contribute to this class and this discipline. Please let me know
if aspects of the instruction, course design, or class activities and content undermine these principles in
any way. To learn about cultivating inclusive experiences, or to voice a concern, check out the Division
of Equity and Inclusion and the Center for Multicultural Academic Excellence.
Communication
I will communicate with the class through Canvas announcements, Canvas messages, and email.
Please make sure to check your Canvas messages and email regularly. I check my own email about
twice daily; you can expect a response within one business day. I will send at least one announcement
each week to remind you of the week’s due dates.
To ask questions about…
● Course content: come to office hours! Office hours are free help sessions - come ask
questions and work together! You can also ask (and answer!) questions on our Course Content
Forum. I cannot efficiently answer content questions by email, but can address common themes
as they emerge on the forum.
● Personal concerns: email me, or book a time to chat privately.
● Procedural questions about assignments (such as due dates) or course policy: Please
post your question on the FAQ Forum. Someone may have already asked (and answered) it!
The goal is to save us all time wasted in email back-and-forth. For instance, if I make a mistake,
sometimes I receive (and then must respond to) a flurry of emails; I would much prefer one FAQ
Forum post which I can address and follow up with an announcement. Thank you in advance!
● Technical challenges with Canvas: contact the UO Service Portal.
I will use Canvas announcements to communicate any course changes made in the event of a campus
emergency, inclement weather, or illness/emergencies of my own. Usually, students will be expected to
continue coursework as outlined on Canvas. Subscribe to UO Alerts for announcements on campus-
wide emergencies or closures.
ASTR 121, Winter 2024: Syllabus - 6

Attendance and Absences
There is no grade penalty for absences; however, attendance is important because we will develop our
knowledge through in-class activities and peer interactions during class. A Zoom option will not be
offered and class will not be recorded; however, recordings from past years will be offered to everyone
in case of illness or just for review. If you do miss class, you are responsible for completing in-class
activities, and are encouraged to attend office hours to discuss key ideas and ask questions.
I will ask you to complete daily attendance logs to record whether you were in class or not and to reflect
on what you’ve learned. The logs will provide us both with information on your attendance patterns. You
can earn extra credit by reflecting on your attendance twice throughout the term.
Late Work and Universal Flexibility
Weekly work in this course is due Mondays at midnight (with the exception of Quizzes, which are due
during class time). Activities never close, but the homework grace period ends Tuesday at noon. Grace
periods are firm end points, to allow for timely feedback.
Our late work policy is reason-neutral (doesn’t apply differently based on the reason for work being
late) and automatic (grace periods are automatically applied and I will drop the lowest activities and
homework during week 7 to assist with decisions about withdrawing). I have built flexibility into the
course through drops and retakes tailored to each learning opportunity. I hope that this combination of
structure and flexibility supports your learning. Unfortunately, I cannot offer additional flexibility.
However, you’re still welcome to email me if you miss an assignment and are unsure of your next
steps. There are exceptions for AEC accommodations and religious observances. If you will miss an
assignment due to a religious observance, please send me the observance form by the end of week 2.
Accessibility Practices
I strive to enable accessible learning for every student by using Universal Design practices, including:
● Captioning:
○ I use presentation software for auto-captioning. It is imperfect, but hopefully helpful.
○ All video content shown during class will be either captioned, or narrated by me.
● Recording: Anyone is welcome to record class. Please confirm consent before recording peers.
● Lengthy Reading: I will provide the page lengths of reading assignments on Canvas.
● Slides Prior to Class: Slides will be provided on Canvas, typically at least 1 day prior to class.
● Cold Calling: I will not cold-call students, but I will often invite volunteers to share their thinking.
● Spelling and Grammar: There will never be a grade penalty for spelling or grammar errors.
● Note sheet for exams: A note sheet will be allowed for everyone (typed or handwritten).
● Registered accommodations through the Accessible Education Center (AEC):
○ Flexibility is not possible for homework, since correct answers are posted immediately
after the grace period. However, the retake option should support your needs.
○ Flexibility is possible For Think & Explains and the Project. To request flexibility, please
email me as soon as is reasonable (and copy your Access Advisor).
○ In-class writing will never have a time limit, as in-class activities never close.
○ Extended time does not apply to quizzes, since both attempts are untimed.
○ Extended time and reduced distraction environments for the final exam are offered
through the AEC. Schedule your exam time by the Friday of week 8.

University Resources
One Stop Resources
A guide to university resources can be found at https://onestop.uoregon.edu/
Basic Needs
Being able to meet your basic needs is foundational to your success as a student. If you are having
difficulty affording food, don’t have a stable, safe place to live, or are struggling to meet another need,
visit the UO Basic Needs Resource page (https://blogs.uoregon.edu/basicneeds) for information on
support for food, housing, healthcare, childcare, transportation, technology, finances, and legal support.
Physical Health and Mental Health Resources
Physical and mental health resources are available through the University Health Center. Students with
COVID symptoms should consult UO’s COVID-19 Safety Resources, and isolate and rest. I appreciate
when students wear a mask when they have a cold, and will do so myself.
Mental health is a critical factor to your overall well being. Students often feel overwhelmed or stressed,
experience anxiety or depression, or just need help navigating challenges in their life. It’s healthy to
seek support. Resources include University Counseling Services and the EMU Duck Nest.
Technology Access
You will need to access Canvas during class time. If you do not have access to a suitable device,
please look into long-term Technology Checkout for Students or Laptop Checkout at the libraries.
Tutoring and Academic Engagement
Learning how to learn is a key theme in our course. The Tutoring and Academic Engagement center
offers free tutoring services and resources on healthy learning routines.
Asking for Help
You are always welcome to speak with me about challenges you are experiencing inside or outside of
the class. If you experience problems causing chronic absences or late work, please let me know so
that I can help connect you with resources. I will proactively communicate with you throughout the term
if I am worried about you, and may refer you to the Care and Advocacy Program if needed.
Academic Integrity
The University Student Conduct Code defines academic misconduct, which includes unauthorized help
on assignments and examinations, using sources without acknowledgement, and publishing class
materials without permission (on Chegg, for instance). I will report suspected misconduct.
Consequences of misconduct can include failure of the relevant assignment, or of the course.
I want you to learn together, and find and cite sources properly! Each assignment will outline whether
and how and whether you might work with others so you can clearly act with academic integrity. Info
about plagiarism: https://researchguides.uoregon.edu/citing-plagiarism
How we use artificial intelligence (ChatGPT, Bing AI, etc) is changing rapidly. Here’s the bottom line:
● These tools are not valid sources of factual information (and are often wrong); do not cite them.
● Don’t let AI do your writing (or thinking) for you - develop these skills yourself!
● These tools sometimes generate embarrassingly wrong answers to astro questions.
ASTR 121, Winter 2024: Syllabus - 8

Reporting Discrimination, Violence, and Sexual Violence
I am a mandatory reporter of child abuse and an assisting employee for discrimination or violence
reporting. As an Assisting Employee, I will direct students who disclose prohibited discrimination and
harassment, including sexual harassment or violence, to resources that can help. I will only report
information to the university administration if the student requesting assistance asks me to report
(unless someone is in imminent risk of serious harm or a minor).
Students who have experienced sexual assault, relationship violence, sex or gender-based bullying,
stalking, and/or sexual harassment may seek resources and help at safe.uoregon.edu or call the 24-7
hotline 541-346-SAFE [7244]. Students experiencing all forms of discrimination or harassment may find
support through the Title IX office or the Dean of Students: investigations.uoregon.edu/how-get-support
Important Academic Policies and Dates
Incomplete Grades
Incomplete grade requests can be made if an unexpected situation happens near the end of the term
which prevents you from completing a minor but essential course requirement. Requests for an
incomplete grade must be initiated by the student, and will only be considered for extenuating
circumstances after the last day to drop (the end of week 7). Emergencies or illness preventing you
from taking the final are the most likely reasons for an incomplete; however, if there is another reason
you think qualifies, please email me and we’ll figure it out together.
For the purposes of interpreting UO’s incomplete policy, satisfactory progress is defined as an overall
pre-final exam grade above 60%. If that threshold is not met, you should proactively communicate with
me to seek help. I will also reach out directly if I have concerns about your engagement or progress.
Petitions and Emergency Academic Notification
While students do have petition options after the term if they were unable to make changes during the
term, you should make an effort to address your situation during the term if possible.
If you experience extraordinary circumstances causing extensive lack of engagement, it may be
appropriate to engage in the Dean of Students’ Emergency Academic Notification process.
