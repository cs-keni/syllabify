Course Objective
This course will provide you with the vocabulary and toolkit for understanding and analyzing the macroeconomy. Most
business decisions occur at the micro level, yet the results of these choices are inevitably influenced by the state of the
broader US and global economies. The global pandemic serves as a perfect illustration of this. Students will learn about
the data used to measure the economy, the basic framework for understanding how the sectors of the economy fit
together, how to understand the current state of the US and global economy, the drivers of business cycles and the key
policies employed to affect economic activity. We will end the class by putting the tools to work analyzing key issues of
the day. Teams of students will be take on a question, learn the research on the issue, analyze the data and develop an
assessment that they present to their colleagues. Students will thereby leave with a practical understanding of how to
employ the macroeconomic toolkit they acquire, as well as an understanding of key economic trends.
Performance Evaluation
Class preparation and participation (10%): Students are expected to have read or listened to all materials assigned for
the class ahead of time. We will start each class covering open questions on the assigned material. I will assign a variety
of readings from a wide variety of sources. We will then spend the class adding to and expanding on the topics covered
in the readings. I welcome questions and discussion and I expect people to listen to and learn from each other.
Special Topic Presentation and Quiz (20%): Students will choose a topic by study group, read some articles based on the
topic, present their findings to the class with their group and take a timed online quiz on the topic of their choice.
Midterm (20%) and Final Exam (50%): The exams will be online, timed multiple-choice exams. The midterm will have a
one week window and the window for taking the final exam will open after the last class and remain open for ten days.
The content of the exam will reflect the required readings as well as material presented and discussed in class, including
student presentations.

McCombs Classroom Professionalism Policy
The highest professional standards are expected of all members of the McCombs community. The collective class
reputation and the value of the Texas MBA experience hinges on this. Faculty are expected to be professional and
prepared to deliver value for each and every class session. Students are expected to be professional in all respects.
The Texas MBA classroom experience is enhanced when:
• Students arrive on time. On time arrival ensures that classes are able to start and finish at the scheduled time. On
time arrival shows respect for both fellow students and faculty and it enhances learning by reducing avoidable
distractions.
• Students display their name cards. This permits fellow students and faculty to learn names, enhancing
opportunities for community building and evaluation of in-class contributions.
• Students minimize unscheduled personal breaks. The learning environment improves when disruptions are limited.
• Students are fully prepared for each class. Much of the learning in takes place during classroom discussions. When
students are not prepared they cannot contribute to the overall learning process. This affects not only the individual,
but their peers who count on them, as well.
• Students respect the views and opinions of their colleagues. Disagreement and debate are encouraged. Intolerance
for the views of others is unacceptable.
• Students do not speak unless they are speaking to the entire class. Unless otherwise instructed by the instructor,
please do not engage in private conversations, however short or innocuous, while the class is in progress. They are
disruptive and discourteous to the speaker. Raise your hand if you have a question or comment.
• Laptops are tablets are used only for classwork and phones are silent. When students are surfing the web,
responding to e-mail, instant messaging each other, and otherwise not devoting their full attention to the topic at
hand they are doing themselves and their peers a major disservice. Those around them face additional distraction.
Fellow students cannot benefit from the insights of the students who are not engaged. If you become aware of a
personal emergency please inform the professor before leaving class.
Remember, you are competing for the best faculty McCombs has to offer. Your professionalism and activity in class
contributes to your success in attracting the best faculty to this program.
Academic Dishonesty
There is no tolerance for acts of academic dishonesty in this class. Such acts damage the reputation of the school and
the degree and demean the honest efforts of the majority of students. The minimum penalty for an act of academic
dishonesty will be a zero for that assignment or exam.
The responsibilities for both students and faculty with regard to the Honor System are described on
http://mba.mccombs.utexas.edu/students/academics/honor/index.asp and on the final pages of this syllabus. As the
instructor for this course, I agree to observe all the faculty responsibilities described therein. During Orientation, you
signed the Honor Code Pledge. In doing so, you agreed to observe all of the student responsibilities of the Honor Code.
If the application of the Honor System to this class and its assignments is unclear in any way, it is your responsibility
to ask me for clarification.
As specific guidance for this course, you should consider the writing of all examinations to be an individual effort. Do
not consult your classmates during the completion of this exam. Group preparation for examinations is acceptable and
encouraged.
