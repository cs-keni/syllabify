This course covers the design and implementation of binary arithmetic as applied to
general purpose and special purpose computers. The focus is on developing high-
speed algorithms for the basic arithmetic operations and understanding their
implementation using VLSI technology at the gate level.

although students may need to find a few articles from the literature.
Grading: • 3 Examinations @ 20% each,
• Project @ 40%
Plus and Minus grades are not used.
Numerical Grade Letter Grade
G ≥ 90% A
90% > G ≥ 80% B
80% > G ≥ 70% C
70% > G ≥ 60% D
60% > G F
Student Project: A properly documented project on a subject of interest to the student
(with approval of the topic by the instructor) is a significant portion of the course
grade. A written report is due on December 4, 2024. The projects may be done by
individuals or by small groups of 2 to 4 students. Each project will be the subject of
a BRIEF presentation of the project results to the class during the last two class
sessions.

Policies:
• Attendance at all classes is expected, but not counted in grading.
• There is no Final Examination, but there are 3 “regular” examinations.
• There are no make-up examinations. Excused absence from an examination
must be approved in advance. Absence is excused only in extreme
circumstances (serious illness, death in the immediate family, etc.). Requests
for excused absences should be made in writing and must be supported by
appropriate documentation. Unexcused absence from an examination will
result in a grade of zero for that examination.
• There is no re-grading of examinations, unless you feel that there is an error.
In this case, you should submit a written request. Verbal requests will not be
considered.
• The fourth class day is the last day of the official add/drop period. Drops after
this time must be approved by the Dean’s office.
• University policies on scholastic dishonesty will be strictly enforced. Students
who violate University rules on scholastic dishonesty (including, but not
limited to, cheating, plagiarism, collusion, or falsifying academic records) are
subject to disciplinary penalties, including failure in the course or dismissal
from the University.
• By UT Austin policy, you must notify me of your pending absence at least
fourteen days prior to the date of observance of a religious holiday. If you
must miss a class, an examination, a work assignment, or a project in order to
observe a religious holiday, you will be given an opportunity to complete the
missed work within a reasonable time after the absence.
• Disabilities: The university is committed to creating an accessible and
inclusive learning environment consistent with university policy and federal
and state law. Please let me know if you experience any barriers to learning so
I can work with you to ensure you have equal opportunity to participate fully
in this course. If you are a student with a disability, or think you may have a
disability, and need accommodations please contact Disability and Access
(D&A). Please refer to D&A’s website for contact and more information:
http://diversity.utexas.edu/disability/. If you are already registered with D&A,
please deliver your Accommodation Letter to me as early as possible in the
semester so we can discuss your approved accommodations and needs in this
course.
• Web-based, password-protected class rosters are associated with all academic
courses taught at the University. Students who do not want their names to be
included in these electronic class rosters must restrict their directory
information in the Office of the Registrar, Main Building, Room 1.

Emergency Preparedness
Every member of the university community must take appropriate and deliberate action
when an emergency strikes a building, a portion of the campus, or entire campus
community. Emergency preparedness means we are all ready to act for our own safety and
the safety of others during a crisis. It takes an effort by all of us to create and sustain an
effective emergency preparedness system.
If you have an emergency either on or off campus, you should call 911 to report the
situation.
Please make note of the phone number for the Behavior Concerns Advice Line (BCAL:
512-232-5050). This is the number to call if you have concerns regarding the attitude or
actions of other students, staff, or faculty. It is advised that you carry this number with you
when you are on campus
Students requiring assistance in evacuation should inform me in writing of their needs
during the first week of class. This information will then be provided to the Fire Prevention
Services office.
If you would like more information regarding emergency preparedness, visit

Emergency Communications
Emergencies may range from inclement weather, to building evacuations, to campus
closures. The university has a variety of tools to communicate with the public in the event
of these and other possible emergencies. Depending on the type of emergency, the
University may use some or all of the following tools to communicate with faculty, staff and
students:
Siren System
The siren system is tested at 11:50 AM on the first Wednesday of every month, and delivers
a siren warning and public address announcement in the event of certain outdoor
emergencies.
Emergency Web Site
You may want to bookmark the emergency Web site because it is updated with information
during actual emergencies or campus closures.
Local Press and Social Media
University Communications staff sends emergency information to the press and update
social media with public safety messages. The university depends a great deal on the press
and social media to keep students, faculty, and staff informed during campus emergencies.

Pager System
Our campus first responders, resident advisors, and some building managers are part of the
AWACS paging system. The pagers send text messages about emergencies on campus and
alert city responders (APD, AFD, EMS, Office of Emergency Management, etc.) to campus
crisis situations.
Fire Panel Systems
Residence halls are equipped with fire panel systems that have a public address capability.
Resident advisors are trained to use these systems in emergencies in order to make
announcements to the entire building regarding evacuation, shelter in place, etc.
Text Alerts
The university collects cell phone numbers from members of the campus community for
emergency text messages.
University Group E-mail
During emergencies, UT Safety Alert sends an “urgent” group e-mail to every student,
faculty and staff member. The e-mail directs individuals to the emergency Web site for
additional information and instruction.
Voicemail to Office Telephones
This tool leaves a voice message on every faculty and staff member’s office phone on
campus.
Public Safety Patrol Car Announcements
UTPD patrol cars are equipped with PA systems, which officers can use to provide
instructions to pedestrians during emergencies.
University Emergency Information Line — 512-232-9999
Students, faculty, and staff can call this main number for information about campus
closures.
