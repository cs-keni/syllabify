What are the objectives of this course?
• To improve your understanding of the economy, stock market, bond market, monetary
policy, and fiscal policy.
• To help you become more conversant about the markets and the economy.
• To help you become a more informed person, better equipped to process financial news.
What materials are required?
• We will use a packet that I have written. The packet contains an outline and slides that
accompany the outline.
o You can either print the packet yourself (it’s on Canvas) or you can buy it at the GSB
Copy Center.
o You need to bring a hard copy of the packet to class. We will not use technology
in the classroom.
• You will need a business calculator for this class. The calculator should have the following
keys: IRR, n, i, PV, PMT, FV, and CF. You should bring a financial calculator to every one
of our class meetings.
What supplemental materials are available?
• On Canvas, there will be additional notes, papers, articles and speeches posted. You are
NOT responsible for any of this supplemental material. Rather, it may help you if you want
to gain a deeper understanding of a particular subject.
What if you need extra help?
• A good OPTIONAL book: Modern Principles of Economics (3rd ed.), by Tyler Cowen and
Alex Tabarrok (2014) (Available on Amazon)
• Later in the syllabus, you will find the relevant chapters to read (completely optional)
What should you read if you want to continue studying after the semester?
• Applied Financial Macroeconomics and Investment Strategy: A Practitioner’s Guide to
Tactical Asset Allocation, by Robert T. McGee (2015) (Available on Amazon)
• Predicting the Markets, by Edward Yardeni (2018)
What sources will be used for the current events portion of the class?
• Our main sources will be Barron’s, The Wall Street Journal, and Project Syndicate. You do
not need to purchase a subscription.
• Very soon, the school will announce a free subscription to Barron’s for students
What are the prerequisites for this class?
• Finance 371M is a Restricted Course for students who are currently enrolled in a major
program in the College of Business Administration. Note that several prerequisites apply
for this course and are published in the Course Catalog. Prior completion of Finance 357 or
Finance 357 H and its prerequisites are among these requirements. I do NOT have any
control over who is admitted to this class.
• While FIN 367 is not a prerequisite, you may be at a disadvantage if you have not
studied bond pricing and yields, duration, the dividend discount model, and stock
market indexes.

Leeds FIN 371M – Spring 2019 page 3
How are grades determined?
• According to the Undergraduate Dean’s Office, the average grade assigned in this class
should be between 3.4 and 3.6. (Obviously, I will abide by this policy.)
• We will have three exams during the semester. In addition, you will have three homework
assignments that will be due the week before each of the exams (in order to help you
prepare). Your grade in the course will be determined as follows:
o Exam 1: 25%
o Exam 2: 30%
o Exam 3: 30%
o Homework: 15% (5% each assignment)
• Grades can be lowered by violating any of the policies described (later) in this
syllabus.
Is homework done alone or with a partner?
• Homework can be done either alone or with one other person.
• Any communication about the assignment with anyone other than your partner is
considered to be academic dishonesty and will result in a grade of zero on the assignment
and an additional decrease of your final course grade by two letter grades.
• If you decide to do the homework alone (and only your name is on your submission), this
means that you are not allowed to discuss it with anyone else.
• Your name must be written on the homework when it is submitted. I will not allow a
second name to be added to an assignment after the homework was submitted.
• You will submit homework electronically (on Canvas).
• Late assignments will not be accepted.
What should you know about the three exams?
• All three exams will be held in class. We will not have a final exam during exam week.
• My exams tend to include most of the material that I have taught (rather than just a few big
questions).
• The tests will include both qualitative and quantitative material. The qualitative questions
are usually multiple-­‐choice and true-­‐false, but short-­‐answer could also be included.
• The difficulty level of the multiple-­‐choice questions is intended to parallel the level of
question that you could face on the CFA® exam. I test on what I teach. This means that
each test will cover what we discuss in class as well as any reading assignments (pre-­‐reads)
and taped lectures (on bonds, multiples, and issues with growth).
• On the tests, you will be responsible for all current events that we discuss in class. (In
many classes, you are not tested on articles about current events. In this class, you
will be tested on these articles. This is a significant part of what this class is designed
to teach.)

Leeds FIN 371M – Spring 2019 page 4
Are old exams available?
• I do not release old exams.
• I have found that releasing old exams is problematic because
o (1) it results in people studying “to the exam” rather than studying to learn; and
o (2) students inevitably feel that old exams are easier than the current exam.
• In addition, I do not allow students to keep their exams. This maintains the fairness of
exams, since you know that no one has seen old exams.
• I consider it to be an act of academic dishonesty if you have access to old exams or grant
access to others. If you come across an old exam (which should not be possible), please
disclose this to me immediately.
• You will have ample opportunity to review your exam.
• With all this said, I have posted some multiple-­‐choice questions that are from the current
event sections of prior semesters. This is done so that you can understand the level of
questions you will face.
Can I find out from others what was on the test? NO!
• I consider it to be academic dishonesty to ask others what was on the exam.
o This means that asking students from prior semesters (or from different sections of
this class) what you should study is an act of academic dishonesty.
• I will be teaching two sections of this class. This means that one section will be taking the
test earlier than the other section. Sharing (or receiving) any information with (from)
someone in another section will result in a course grade of F for any and all people
involved.
o I am committed to fairness in grading and I will enforce this in the most aggressive
way possible. I will do my best to ensure fairness – which is something that you all
want.

Leeds FIN 371M – Spring 2019 page 5
What is the really big picture about the attendance policy?
• In short, this is a great class and a fun class. But, I need 75 minutes of your time, twice per
week. I need you to be on time and engaged in the class (not engaged with your
technology). This needs to be a professional environment.
• I need you to be on time so that you get the most of the class and that you don’t disrupt the
class.
o Please understand that some of your peers have a letter from the Dean of Students
that requires me to provide a distraction-­‐free environment for these students to
learn. I enforce this by penalizing students who create distractions.
• You must be able to sit for 75 minutes without any technology. Your grade gets lowered
drastically (see below) each time you use a cell phone in class.
• In sum, I need you to come to class, be on time, stay for the entire class, pay attention (don’t
use technology), and enjoy our time together. Simply be professional and enjoy class. Now,
here’s the long version of the rules…
What is the point system that is used to impact grades?
• Accumulating more than 2.5 points will result in your course grade being lowered:
o 2.51 – 3 points: 1 letter grade (e.g., A-­‐ gets lowered to B+)
o 3.01 – 4 points: 2 letter grades (e.g., A-­‐ gets lowered to B)
o 4.01 – 4.5 points: 3 letter grades (e.g., A-­‐ gets lowered to B-­‐)
o 4.51 – 5 points: 4 letter grades (e.g., A-­‐ gets lowered to C+)
o 5.01 points or more: receive an F in the course
How do you receive points?
• Missing class: 1 point
o Missing class due to an off-­‐campus interview (see instructions below): ½ point
• Arriving late (NOTE: if I’ve started speaking and you’re not seated, you’re late.)
o Late (but you arrive in the first five minutes): ½ point
o More than five minutes late: 1 point
o Arrive late, but do not sit in front row or do not write “LATE” next to your name on
the sign-­‐in sheet: 1.5 points
• Leaving early
o Leave early (within the last five minutes of class): ½ point
o Leave more than five minutes early: 1 point
o Leave early without noting this on the sign-­‐in sheet: 1.5 points
• Use of cell-­‐phone/tablet/technology in class: 2.5 points per occurrence
How do you ensure that you only lose ½ point for an off-­‐campus interview absence?
• You must email my TA, Michael McCorry 48 hours in advance. (Do not email me or cc me
for attendance issues.) Your email should include documentation, including the name of
the employer and all details about the interview. Michael’s email address is
Michael.McCorry@mba19.mccombs.utexas.edu

Leeds FIN 371M – Spring 2019 page 6
What if you are sick?
• This counts as an absence. This is why you are allowed to miss two classes. This is why
you should not waste your absences.
• If you have a letter from the office of the Dean of Students concerning your sickness, I will
take that into consideration.
Should you email me about absences or sickness?
• No, there is no need to email me about this type of issue. I trust that you are an adult and
that you are making the best decisions for your situation.
• You should trust that I am trying to run the very best class for the most people.
• If you have a unique situation, we will consider this. But, normal illness is why you’re
allowed two absences (one week).
How do religious holidays work?
• If you have a religious holiday, you should email my TA, Michael McCorry, one week ahead
of time. This must be a recognized religious holiday, not a trip for religious purposes.
Michael’s email address is Michael.McCorry@mba19.mccombs.utexas.edu.
What if you have a school-­‐sponsored event?
• School-­‐sponsored events will not count as absences. You must submit a letter from the
University forty-­‐eight hours ahead of time. This should be submitted electronically to my
TA, Michael McCorry. Michael’s email address is
Michael.McCorry@mba19.mccombs.utexas.edu.
• Case competitions, student group trips, etc. are not considered school-­‐sponsored events.
Plan ahead and use your point allowance wisely.
What should you do if you are late for class?
• You should walk in quietly and you MUST sit in the front row. If there are no seats
available in the front row, you should sit in the second row.
• When you sign the attendance sheet, you must write LATE next to your name.
Does it matter why you were late for class?
• No, it doesn’t matter why you were late for class.
o Please do not send me excuses or reasons for being late. I do not distinguish
between an interview running late or a bus running late.
• I understand that things happen – your bus is late or you overslept. If you look at the
point system, you’ll see that being late once won’t impact your grade. But, if you are
frequently late, this class is going to be a problem for you.
What if you need to leave class early?
• Prior to class, you should tell me that you’re leaving early and you should sit close to the
door.
• On the sign-­‐in sheet, you should write “Left Early” next to your name.

Leeds FIN 371M – Spring 2019 page 7
What if something unexpected happens at the end of the semester and you have already
used your absences?
• There’s nothing that can be done about this.
• Do not waste these allowed absences. Assume that emergencies will arise. You don’t
know when you will get sick or when you will have a family emergency. You should be
saving your absences for this type of event. Please do not come to me and ask me to
make exceptions for you. It would be unfair for me to hold some members of the class to
a particular standard and to relax that standard for others.
• It is crucial that you do not approach the attendance policy with an eye toward maximizing
the number of times that you can miss class.
Can you attend a different section of this class?
• You can attend a different section of this class twice during the semester. You do not need
to contact me about this ahead of time.
• When you attend the other class, simply print your name at the bottom of the sign-­‐in sheet.
• On the three test days, you must attend the class in which you are enrolled unless you
received permission from me to take the exam with the other class.
• During the last week of class, you need to attend the section of the class that you are
enrolled in. If you need an exception to this, please see me.
Can you leave during class and return?
• It is my expectation that you should be able to sit through our 75-­‐minute class without
getting up. Please fill up your water bottle before you come to class. Do not leave because
you are receiving a phone call (if you do this, it means that you have violated the cell phone
policy). I understand that you may feel sick or need to use the restroom and that this
happens once or twice during a semester. That’s absolutely fine. But, if this is something
that you anticipate happening more than twice during the semester, you should discuss the
issue with me. It may be that you need an accommodation letter from the Dean of Students.
The bottom line is that this is a bad course to take if you don’t plan on attending class, you can’t
make it on time, or you can’t live without your cell phone. If you attend class and put in a good
effort, I’m confident that you will learn a lot and you’ll enjoy the experience. Rest assured…I will
hold myself to a higher standard than I will hold you.

Weather Disruptions, Instructor Absence, or Falling Behind Schedule: if class is cancelled due
to weather or instructor absence, we will most likely have a taped lecture to make up for the class.
I have only missed class twice (in 17 years), but it is always possible that issues can arise.
In addition, if we fall behind in class (because we spend additional time discussing current
events), it is possible that there might be a taped lecture to make sure we stay on track.

Academic Dishonesty
Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated. Any individual suspected of cheating, including
stealing or using stolen examinations, will be disciplined to the maximum extent possible. Review
UT Honor Code at http://registrar.utexas.edu/catalogs/gi09-­‐10/ch01/index.html
The McCombs School of Business has no tolerance for acts of scholastic dishonesty. The
responsibilities of both students and faculty with regard to scholastic dishonesty are described in
detail in the Policy Statement on Scholastic Dishonesty for the McCombs School of Business:
By teaching this course, I have agreed to observe all of the faculty responsibilities described in that
document. By enrolling in this class, you have agreed to observe all of the student responsibilities
described in that document. If the application of that Policy Statement to this class and its
assignments is unclear in any way, it is your responsibility to ask me for clarification. Policy on
Scholastic Dishonesty: Students who violate University rules on scholastic dishonesty are subject to
disciplinary penalties, including the possibility of failure in the course an/or dismissal from the
University. Since dishonesty harms the individual, all students, and the integrity of the University,
policies on scholastic dishonesty will be strictly enforced. You should refer to the Student Judicial
Services website at http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/ or the General Information Catalog to
access the official University policies and procedures on scholastic dishonesty as well as further
elaboration on what constitutes scholastic dishonesty.

Religious Holidays
By UT Austin policy, you must notify me of your pending absence at least fourteen days prior to
the date of observance of a religious holy day. If you miss a class, an examination, a work
assignment or a project in order to observe a religious holy day, you will be given an opportunity
to complete the missed work within a reasonable time after the absence.
