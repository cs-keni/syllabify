TEXTBOOK: StatsPortal: The Basic Practice of Statistics (6th edition) David S. Moore + looseleaf of
the text. StatsPortal contains an e-Book and many other resources which are required for this course. You
may purchase your StatsPortal access card + looseleaf at the bookstore. The ISBN is 1-4641-1125-1.
During class lecture, I will address questions from textbook assignments and you will work problems
dealing with the new material so be sure to bring your printed textbook to class. Once you have purchased
your StatsPortal access card, you will need to activate it as follows:
StatsPortal: To sign up for your course, you should do the following
1. Go to http://courses.bfwpub.com/bps6e.php (Mac users need to use Firefox)
2. Click on the link “REGISTER AN ACTIVATION CODE”
3. You will be prompted to follow the on-screen instructions to find your course.
4. You will enter the activation code that came with your StatsPortal purchase. If you
purchased a hard back book with an access card, use the access card to activate
StatsPortal. You will be asked to enter your email address, choose a password, and
then you will be ready to go!
We will cover Chapters 1-24; Chapters 7, 17, and 22 are reviews. You are expected to read each chapter
carefully; pay close attention to examples, items in bold print, items in boxes, etc. You should read the
chapter before I lecture on it (See Lecture Schedule on Blackboard). In addition to reading assignments,
there will be written assignments from the textbook and assignments on StatsPortal. You will need to bring
a 2 variable statistical calculator, looseleaf textbook, and clean sheets of paper to class daily. Please be
advised that the material covered in roughly the second half of this course is more difficult than the
material in the earlier chapters. A lecture schedule can be found on page 4 of this First Day Handout; the
schedule describes the major topics covered during each of your classes.
Helpful information and websites:
1. You should read Pages xxi-xxiv “For Students” for descriptions of many learning resources
available to you through StatsPortal, including Statistical videos, Stat Tutor, Leaning Curve,
interactive statistical applets, interactive exercises, software manuals, online-quizzes, and data sets.
2. https://courses.utexas.edu (Blackboard) Assignments, the syllabus, lecture schedule,
review materials and many other important documents can be found at this site.
3. https://quest.cns.utexas.edu Scores on midterms will be available on Quest.

4. www.whfreeman.com quick access to Applets from prior editions of the text.
CALCULATOR: You will need a basic, non-graphing, 2-variable statistical calculator (e.g. TI-30XIIS,
TI-35X, or Casio fx-300 MS). Be sure you know how to use your calculator by practicing outside class.
Always bring your calculator to class as you will need it for work we do in class. When using your
calculator, avoid repeated rounding off as this will cause your final result to be incorrect; you should round
only at the last step. Using the memory can be helpful and improve accuracy and efficiency. You will be
allowed to use only this basic calculator during midterms and the final exam. TI-83, Ti-85, etc calculators
will not be used during tests or quizzes or the final exam.
TECHNOLOGY: “Using Technology” sections are found throughout our book; each displays and comments on
output from TI83Plus, Minitab, Excel and CrunchIt! You will have some assigned problems where you will use
software; there are quick links to software with many of the problems in your e-book. You must be very familiar with
output from these various types of software. You will not be permitted to use software during midterms nor during the

final exam; however, you will be expected to interpret software output presented on your midterms and final exam as
well as classwork.
ATTENDANCE: There is a strong negative association between the number of days missed by a student and that
student’s average at the end of the course. There is no direct penalty for missing class. However, if you are absent or
arrive late, you miss instruction, announcements, classwork, and quizzes which cannot be made up. The most
effective way to learn the material is to do all reading assignments before class, attend every class, be actively engaged
in the class, participate in class activities, fill in your class notes promptly, and do the assignment as soon as possible
after the lecture. If you must miss class, you should get the notes from a classmate.
Class Participation: This is a large class and I will do my best to make it run smoothly. I will solicit your help in
many ways such as passing out activities, collecting papers, erasing the chalkboard at the end of class, etc. You can also
help in the following ways: Always come to class prepared and on time. If you are late unavoidably, please come in
as quietly as possible and sit down quickly. The configuration of our classroom makes late arrivals extremely
disruptive to other students. If you have a question that is pertinent to the majority of the class, please, please ask (e.g.
Would you please speak more loudly? Did you intend that to be sigma or s? I got a different answer., etc) You are
encouraged to help each other during class but please be sure such conversations are about statistics and keep it fairly
soft so other people are not disrupted. Personal questions should be addressed during my office hours; no
appointment is needed. ALL CELL PHONES AND OTHER ELECTRONIC DEVICES MUST BE TURNED
COMPLETELY OFF DURING CLASS AND EXAMS.
TESTS: (300 points) There will be 3 midterms, each worth 100 points, during your regular class time. There will not
be any makeup or rescheduled tests for any reason. Tentative test dates are
Sept 28 (Chapters 1-5, 8-9) Oct 19 (Chapters 10-12, 14, 15) Nov 19(Chapters 13,16, 18-21, 24)
The best preparation for your midterms is practice with the problems in your textbook. The problems on your tests
closely resemble those in your book. This math course, unlike most, requires more reading and interpreting so study
the examples in your text and those done during class. Each midterm may have a multiple choice section and a
problem section. Prior to each midterm, during class I will give information concerning the format of the midterm.
If you must miss a test for illness or family emergency, let me know prior to the test. Some verification of the illness or
emergency will be required. If you miss a test due to a valid reason (as determined by me), the points missed on the
test will be made up on the final exam. You can do this for no more than one test. Tests will be returned in class,
usually the next class. Any questions concerning the grading must be addressed within a week after papers are returned
in class. ** I will arrange outside class time, to go over the test. Everyone is invited to come; if you scored below 70%
you should make the appropriate arrangements to come. I keep grades in Excel format; as a courtesy to my students, I
also will make test scores available online.
DAILY WORK (75 points). Daily work includes textbook assignments, class activities, class quizzes, and
assignments on StatsPortal. Textbook assignments are due at the beginning of class on the due date and
cannot be accepted late for any reason. Papers should be ready for turn in when you come to class (stapled,
name on front, properly folded, etc). Work must be shown in a clear, organized manner and must support
your answer. Circle answers, when appropriate; use a ruler when making graphs. Due to time constraints,
only selected problems on a textbook assignment will be scored and there will be some assignments that are
not collected at all. Each graded textbook assignment is worth 10 points. Similarly, each class quiz, class
activity and StatsPortal assignment will be worth 10 points. Learning Curve and video assignments will be
scored as a 10 or a 0. Please be attentive to due dates for online assignments; they will be listed on
StatsPortal. Textbook assignments may be turned in early by putting then under my office door. The date
I receive such papers will be written at the top of that assignment. Class work and quizzes cannot be made
up so you must plan to attend all classes.
At the end of the semester, scores on daily work will be averaged and weighted 75 points towards the semester grade.
It is your responsibility to pick up scored daily work from my office during office hours. You would be wise to keep all
daily work in a binder for test preparation and also because some of the problems will be referenced again in future
chapters.
FINAL EXAM (150 points) December 15, 9-noon
The final exam will be comprehensive. Location to be announced.
Course Grade: [Daily weighted+ Midterm#1+Midterm#2+Midterm#3+Final Exam]/525
A 90-100%; B 80-89.9%; C 70-79.9%; D 60-60.9%; F < 60%
**Any curve will be determined after the final exam. Use of plus/minuses will be at my discretion.

Further information and notes:
A. This course carries the Quantitative Reasoning flag. QR courses are designed to equip you with skills that are necessary for
understanding the types of quantitative arguments you will regularly encounter in your adult and professional life. You should,
therefore, expect a substantial portion of your grade to come from your use of quantitative skills to analyze real-world problems.
B. My major goals for your class are to teach you the basic ideas of descriptive and inferential statistics, point out the many areas in
which an understanding of statistics is relevant, help you to think for yourself, stimulate you intellectually, and allow you to express
your ideas freely.
C. The University of Texas provides appropriate academic accommodations for qualified students with disabilities. For more
information, contact the Office of the Dean of Students at 471-6259, 471-6441 TTY. If you qualify under the University’s Learning
Disability Policy, your letter from the Dean will take effect after it is presented to your instructor
D. Please do not bring any food or drink into our classroom.
E. I want you to be an active participant in your class. In most cases when I ask a question, I really am trying to get you to think more
deeply and come up with a response. I do not want anyone to be reluctant to respond for fear of giving a wrong answer. A great deal
of learning can occur even from a wrong answer. I reserve the right to award bonus daily points to students who present problems to
the class.
F. You should read each chapter carefully before we start discussing it in class (See Lecture Schedule). Be sure you understand the
problems within each chapter section as well as those at the end of each chapter. You may need to do more problems than just those
assigned to thoroughly understand the material, particularly the language, of this course. I strongly encourage you to watch for
newspaper or other reports involving statistics and read them with a critical eye.
G. Prerequisite and degree relevance: A minimal score of 30% on the ALEKS placement exam or C- or better in any precalculus or
calculus course. This course may not be counted toward the major requirement for the Bachelor of Arts with a major in mathematics
or toward the Bachelor Science in Mathematics. Only one of the following may be counted: Mathematics 316, 306K (Topic 1:
Applications of Probability Theory), 362K, Statistics and Scientific Computation 303, 304, 305, 306.
H. If you find a topic is confusing, please seek help immediately. If you have any other concerns or frustrations, please discuss these
with me or Chris.
I. Please always print your name and EID on any papers submitted. If you must email, always tell me your entire name and your EID.
Before emailing, check to see if the information which you need is contained in the First Day Handout or in class notes.
J. There are many computer resources available to you. There is an undergraduate computer lab in RLM 7.122 and is open to all
students enrolled in math courses. You may sign up for an individual account in the lab using your UT EID.
K. I do not have office hours on test days due to other responsibilities.
Important dates:
Sept 4 Tuesday Last day of the official add/drop period; after this date, changes in
registration require the approval of the department chair and usually the student’s
dean. (See General Information, chapter 4, for details.)
Last day undergraduate students may register and pay tuition without the approval of
the registrar.
Sept 14 Friday Twelfth class day; this is the date the official enrollment count is
taken. Last day an undergraduate student may add a class except for rare and
extenuating circumstances. Last day to drop a class for a possible refund.
Nov 6 Tuesday Last day an undergraduate student may, with the dean’s approval,
withdraw from the University or drop a class except for urgent and substantiated,
nonacademic reasons.
Last day an undergraduate student may change registration in a class to or from a
pass/fail basis.
