BIO s325 – GENETICS MTWThF
Summer 2011 – Second Session 10:00-11:30am
Prof: Janice Fischer RLM 6.104
COURSE INFORMATION AND POLICIES
REQUIRED BOOKS
1. Genetics: From Genes to Genomes – 4rd edition by Hartwell et al. (McGraw-Hill
publishers) If you buy this book, you will have on-line access to the web supplement:
“Genetic Portrait Chapters”. There will reading assigned from this supplement as well. You
will also have access to a variety of animations and study aids on the website associated
with the book. You might find these useful.
There is also an ebook available for purchase at a lower cost if you prefer.
2. Solutions Manual for problems in Hartwell textbook (authored by Nero).
LECTURES
This course will consist of a series of lectures covering a broad range of topics in
GENETICS. Lectures will be based mainly on material in the textbook. However, some
information is not in the book. When this occurs, supplementary reading will be posted on
Blackboard.
My job in lecture:
(1) My lectures are designed to let you know which material is important for you to
understand and study. The exams will cover only the material that I cover in class.
(2) My aim in lecture is to present the material in a manner that helps you to understand it
better and more quickly that if you only read the textbook on your own.
(3) I aim to put the material in perspective so that you can see why it is useful to know
these things.
Your job in lecture:
1. You are expected to show up every day.
2. You are expected to be prepared. You should do the assigned reading before you
come to class. That way, you will be able to follow the lecture and be able to ask
questions.
BLACKBOARD
I will use the Blackboard website for this course to post the following:
(1) Powerpoints of my lectures. These will be posted the day before the lecture.
(2) Supplementary reading or other material
(3) Detailed answers to the Exams and exam grad statistics
(4) Important Announcements
Make sure that your email address on Blackboard is accurate as I may email the class with
important announcements

HOMEWORK AND STUDYING
Learning GENETICS is like learning to play a musical instrument or learning to excel in a
sport that requires eye-hand coordination. You need to practice a lot in order to synthesize
and solidify new neural circuits in your brain. Your brain needs to rewire itself physically in
order for you to think abstractly like a geneticist. Yes, really. Think of me the way you
think about your music teacher or your athletic coach. In lecture, I can explain to you
what it is you need to practice thinking and why, but I cannot do the thinking practice for
you. You must do it yourself, and as much as possible. MEMORIZING, OR TRYING TO STUDY
SPECIFICALLY TO PASS AN EXAM, WILL GET YOU NOWHERE IN THIS COURSE. So please,
for your own sake, stop thinking about school that way.
***You have to keep up with the class every day and every weekend because the
summer course is relentless and goes by quickly! For example, the comprehensive final
is the day after the last lecture!!! Summer session is “total immersion” Genetics. Here
is a guide for how to keep up:
You have several homework assignments every single day.
1. Make sure that you understand what happened in class that day. Re-read the material
for the lecture you just heard, and identify questions to bring to Discussion Section or
Office Hours.
2. Read the book chapter(s) for the next day’s lecture.
3. At the end of each chapter, there are excellent problems to solve, and solving them will
help you to understand lecture. Your TA will assign specific problems that are most
relevant. However, these are the absolute minimum number that you should work through.
You have the answers to all of them, with explanations, in the solutions manual.
4. You are registered for a Discussion Section twice weekly and I have an office hour every
single afternoon (see below). If there’s something you don’t understand, don’t let it go! Get
your questions answered promptly.
Do not feel constrained in your learning by your textbook or the supplementary reading
that I post. That would be crazy! I think that the textbook is very good, but you have the
whole world in your hands at the keyboard of a computer. Don’t hesitate to use the
internet to find additional helpful reading material. However, as always, DO NOT TRUST
THE ACCURACY OF EVERYTHING you read on the internet. If anything you read seems at
odds with the way we discussed something in class, please tell me or your TA about it in
discussion section. This could spark interesting discussion. Also, when we talk about
molecular biology techniques and experiments, you might want to look for demonstrations of
these techniques on YouTube. Yes – YouTube!!! There are videos of people performing
various laboratory techniques, and seeing this can sometimes help you understand the
laboratory procedures that you have not yourself done or witnessed.
The University Course Guidelines suggest that for each hour a course meets, an average of
2 additional hours of studying is expected of the student. Therefore, taking this course over
the summer is obviously a 20-hour per week job. The course material is highly analytical
and draws from a broad knowledge base. Thus, it will require a lot of time.

DISCUSSION SESSIONS
There will be 4 discussion sessions per week, the times of which are listed below. The
purpose of the discussion sections is for you to avail yourselves of your TA, who will be
there prepared to answer any questions you might have about the lecture material or
homework problems. The discussion sessions are your opportunity to meet with your TA and
ask questions about lecture material or about the practice problems in the book. Provided
that there are enough seats in the room, you may attend as many discussion sessions as you
like and as your schedule allows. The expectation is that you are available for at least
two of these sessions per week as this is what you agreed to when you signed up for
this class. Please remember that the TA is not your personal 24/7 tutor, and that you
have to show up prepared at Discussion Session to get the help that you need. Please
also remember that NOTHING MAGICAL is going to happen in discussion session. By this
I mean that merely attending discussion sections is NOT a substitute for your own personal
studying, and the TA is not responsible for your learning the material or for your grade.
Taking personal responsibility to work hard on your own, and bringing your questions and
difficulties to discussion session is the only way to do well in this class. Your TA will provide
you with more information about how he plans to run discussion sessions.
Discussion Session Schedule:
TuTh 1:00pm-2:00pm RLM 6.116
TuTh 2:00pm-3:00pm WEL 6.116
EXAMS
There will be three exams in the course: two mid-terms and a final. The mid-term exams
are during class (see schedule), and the final is scheduled by UT during Final Exam week
(see date and time on schedule below). The final exam will be comprehensive. The two mid-
term exams will consist of short-answer questions and problems. The final exam will be
multiple choice.
Look at the dates and times of all three exams in order to be certain that you are
able to attend. The University allows me to give make-up exams only for officially
sanctioned reasons such as documented serious illness, etc. I am not allowed to give
make-up exams for any planned absences, such as weddings, family vacations, or
anything of that nature.

GRADES
Your final course grade will be computed as follows:
30% midterm exam #1
30% midterm exam #2
40% final exam
The average on exams is usually 75%, and the class grades are usually curved so that the
numerical average of all four exams is the lowest B-. Information regarding the grade-
spread of the class as a whole will be available after each exam. This is meant to give you
a rough idea of what your numerical score means. I will not assign letter grades to each
exam. At the end of the class, your numerical average will be used as the basis for your
letter grade. I will assign grades using the +/- system.
It is impossible to predict your final grade until the course is over for several reasons. (1) I
do not use a quota system for assigning grades – there are not a set number of As, Bs, Cs,
etc. and nobody has to fail the class. That means that I do not use mathematical formulas
to assign the cut-offs for different grades. I use my judgment to do this at the end of the
class. For example, the system described above is based on the expectation that the class
average on exams is about 75% - which is what I expect. Using my judgement instead of
mathematical formulas and thus quotas means that if the whole class gets above 90% on
every exam, everybody gets an A. (2) People who are not doing well inevitably drop the
course along the way, so the class average inevitably goes way up by the end of the class
relative to what it was at the start. This means that if your first exam grade was average,
it will almost certainly be below average when I calculate the grades at the end of the
class.
Exams will be graded by me (JF). If you ever feel that a mistake has been made in
grading your Exam, you must submit your entire exam for regrading WITHIN TWO DAYS
OF THE DATE THAT I HANDED IT BACK IN CLASS. There is only one way to submit exams
for regrading: hand it to me either before or after class. You must attach to your exam a
succinct note explaining precisely what mistake you think that I made. Indicate which
question you are talking about and why you think your answer has more merit than I
thought it did. Exams submitted after the two day deadline will not be regraded.
THERE IS NO WAY TO EARN EXTRA CREDIT IN THIS CLASS. YOUR GRADE WILL BE
DETERMINED SOLELY BY YOUR PERFORMANCE ON THE THREE EXAMS.

OFFICE HOURS
If you want to meet with me one-on-one outside of class, my office hours reserved
specifically for this class are MONDAY-FRIDAY, 4:00pm – 5:00pm, in MBB 1.312AA. You
can just drop by without an appointment during these times. If you have a compelling
reason to see me outside of my office hours, please send me an e-mail
(jaf@mail.utexas.edu) to arrange an alternate appointment, and I will accommodate you if
I am able. I read and answer my e-mail every single day, but I hate my telephone
passionately. I will attempt to answer simple questions (if there are such things) via e-mail.
It is not possible for me to answer complex questions about the course material by e-mail
or over the telephone.
My office hours are not meant to be a substitute for going to Discussion Session. For
example, it is unlikely that I will be able to spend the entire hour with you, as others may
be waiting. They are meant to be a different and supplemental experience – a chance to
ask me specific things about the course material that maybe you didn’t get a chance to ask
in Discussion Session, or a chance to discuss a topic with me that you did not have time to
discuss in enough detail in Discussion Session.
PLEASE DO:
-Come to my office hours to introduce yourself! I’d love to get to know you. I’d like to do
what I can to make your learning experience at UT more meaningful and more fun.
-Come to my office hours to ask me questions (easy ones or hard ones) about the course
material. I love clarifying concepts one-on-one. Teaching undergraduates about genetics is
one of my favorite parts of my job.
-Come to my office hours with a flash drive to get a tape of a lecture you missed. I record
the lectures in case you are sick and miss a class.
PLEASE DON’T: (alternate title: a list of ways to annoy the Professor)
- Do not come to my office hours to ask me to repeat a lecture that you didn’t attend.
- Do not come to my office hours to ask me to explain something to you if you have not
done your part of the job – meaning done the assigned reading for that topic.
- Do not come to my office hours to ask me what the test is going to be like. This is a
waste of time for both of us.
- Do not come to my office hours to ask me why I gave you fewer points on your exam than
you think you deserve. I won’t discuss that with you during my office hours. All discussion
of grading is done in writing. (See above for how to submit exams for regrading.)

WHO AM I?
Who is Janice Fischer and why does she get to teach me Genetics? Good question! I am a
tenured Full Professor here at UT. I earned my PhD in 1988 in Biochemistry and Molecular
Biology at Harvard University. My research was about gene regulation using Drosophila
(fruit flies) as a model system. Then I did postdoctoral research at UC Berkeley and MIT
where I learned a lot more about Drosophila genetics and development. I started out as an
Assistant Professor here at UT in 1993, and I have been teaching BIO 325 since 1996. For
10 years, I used to teach a graduate course about genetic model systems and I am thinking
about morphing this class into an Advanced Genetics class that will be available in a year or
so under the number BIO366R. My other job at UT is to run my research lab, which is in
MBB. I have several PhD students and undergraduates doing research in my lab. We use
Drosophila as a genetic model system to understand molecular aspects of development, such
as how cells communicate with each other to form patterns and organs. I discovered during
my junior year in college, when I learned about the genetic code, that I wanted to be a
molecular geneticist – and here I am!! I love genetics – and my aim is to transfer that to
you. As per University Guidelines, my resume is posted on Blackboard.
