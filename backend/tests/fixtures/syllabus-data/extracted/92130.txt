16. Quizzes are every Thursday in the discussion session. There are no make-up quizzes. There
won’t be a quiz on July 12th before the Midterm. The Final will be scheduled by the Registrar
probably on August 11 from 7 to 10 p.m. Exams and quizzes will be closed-book, closed-notes, and
no-calculator.
Homework Assignments on are on the next page and are subject to change. Due dates are an-
nounced in class and no where else. Late home work will not be accepted, and it hurts to ask.
Homework is due at the beginning of the discussion session. Staple multiple pages and polish your
work; we take points off for missing staples and sloppy or disorganized work.
Overview In this course we will study differentiation of multivariable and vector-valued functions
and applications thereof. Then we will study integration over higher-dimensional regions, and over
paths and surfaces. The course culminates in Stokes’ Theorem, which is the multi- dimensional
version of the fundamental theorem of calculus. Prerequisite: A grade of C or better in M408D or
the equivalent.
