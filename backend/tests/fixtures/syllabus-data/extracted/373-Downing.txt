Prerequisites
The following coursework with a grade of at least C- in each: Computer Science 311,
311H, 313H, or 313K; Computer Science 307, 314, 314H, 315, or 315H; Computer

Writing Flag
This course carries the Writing Flag. Writing Flag courses are designed to give students
experience with writing in an academic discipline. In this class, you can expect to write
regularly during the semester, complete substantial writing projects, and receive
feedback from your instructor to help you improve your writing. You will also have the
opportunity to revise one or more assignments, and you may be asked to read and

discuss your peers' work. You should therefore expect a substantial portion of your
grade to come from your written work. Writing Flag classes meet the Core
Communications objectives of Critical Thinking, Communication, Teamwork, and
Personal Responsibility, established by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board.
Special Needs
Any student with a documented disability who requires academic accommodations
should contact Services for Students with Disabilities at 471-6259 (voice) or
1-866-329-3986 (Video Phone) as soon as possible to request an official letter outlining
authorized accommodations.
You must provide this letter to me by the 12th class day. Project deadlines will not be
extended for special-needs students.
Incompletes
To be eligible for an incomplete you must have a letter grade of C or better and a written,
verifiable excuse for missing the last test. This is a necessary but insufficient condition
for receiving an incomplete.
Academic Integrity
Students who violate University rules on academic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary
penalties, including the possibility of failure in the course and/or dismissal from the
University. Since such dishonesty harms the individual, all students, and the integrity of
the University, policies on academic dishonesty will be strictly enforced. For further
information please visit the Student Judicial Services Web site: Student Judicial
Services.
Programming assignments will be compared using Moss. You may share design ideas
with your fellow students. You may not share code in any way with your fellow students.
The penalty for academic dishonesty will be a course grade of F and a referral of the case
to the Dean of Students. Further penalties, including suspension or expulsion from the
university may be imposed by that office.
