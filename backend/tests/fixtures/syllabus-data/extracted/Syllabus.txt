Grading:
Homework 10%
Laboratory 10%
Semester Exams 50% (2 exams during semester, 25% each)
Final Exam 30%
Your final course grade will be determined using these course components and weightings. Per
University policy, you must notify me of your pending absence at least fourteen days prior to the
date of observance of a religious holy day. If you must miss a class, an examination, a work
assignment, or a project in order to observe a religious holy day, you will be given an opportunity
to complete the missed work within a reasonable time after the absence. Class attendance is not
considered explicitly in computation of your course grade, but is strongly recommended as an
important part of your learning process. Each course component will be graded on a curve, rather
than an absolute scale, for translation of numerical to letter grades. This will almost certainly result
in your receiving a higher letter grade than if the traditional absolute scale were employed. Final
grades will be assigned using +/- grade increments.
Notes on exam grading: For exam problems, reasoning and analysis are typically as or more
important than the final answer. You should explain your reasoning clearly and show all work. Be
sure to erase or cross out any work you do not want to be considered in grading. If you demonstrate
mastery of the key concepts required to solve a problem, you will receive substantial credit even
if the final answer is not completely correct. Conversely, a correct final answer without explanation
or justification will typically receive very limited credit. Any requests for exam regrades must be
made in writing with an explanation of the issue in question, and within one week of your receiving
your original graded exam. If an exam regrade is requested, the entire exam may be regraded and
your total score may increase or decrease.
Drop Policy: All adds and drops should be discussed with your academic advisor. The last day to
drop this course without permission from the Dean and the department advisor is the twelfth class
day. After this day, drops are not approved unless students can demonstrate “good cause”, i.e.
health or personal problems that did not exist at the end of the official add and drop period.
Academic performance, such as making poor exam grades, is not a valid reason to drop. University
add/drop policies and information may be found at the UT Austin Registrar’s web site:
https://registrar.utexas.edu/students/registration/after/add-drop.
Policy on Collaboration: Discussion of course material and homework problems is permitted (and
encouraged!). However, each student should work through the homework problems (and write up
their solutions) independently. For additional details please see the section of this syllabus on
Policy on Academic Integrity.

Course Policy on Academic Integrity:
Ethics and integrity in both academic and professional affairs should be part of your
education at UT Austin. Academic integrity is a serious matter and will be treated as such in ECE
411. My hope is that this will be beneficial to your education both technically and in a much
broader sense.
While I am confident that the large majority of students will naturally adhere to the university’s
guidelines and regulations regarding academic integrity, I provide below an explicit statement of
course policy in this regard.
Homework: ECE 411 course policy is that discussion of course material, including homework
problems, is allowed and indeed encouraged. However, each student should work through assigned
homework problems and write up their solutions independently. Problem-solving is an extremely
useful skill in itself, and in addition is the only really effective way to learn the material!
Specifically, each student is responsible for working out and writing up their own solutions to each
homework assignment. Discussion of the course material and problems is encouraged, but
practices such as allowing a classmate to copy your homework solutions, or a group working out
a problem solution together which everyone then copies down and turns in, are forbidden. Use of
problem solutions obtained from other students, over the web, etc. is forbidden. Students violating
course policy on homework will receive a warning possibly followed by a grading penalty and
further disciplinary action, in accordance with university policy.
Examinations: In general you will be allowed to use a calculator, writing implements and erasers,
and the exam question/answer sheets during exams. Any other allowed materials will be specified
in advance of each exam. Students who are caught using unauthorized materials during an exam,
copying from a classmate on exams, continuing to work on an exam after time has been called, or
violating exam or course rules in some other manner are likely, at a minimum, to receive a score
of zero on that exam and may be subject to further disciplinary action, again in accordance with
university policy.
For further information: Additional information concerning UT Austin’s policy on conduct and
academic integrity is posted on the UT Austin web site at
http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/conduct/.
Laboratory: The laboratory sessions for this class are in-person only, and occur once per week
for two hours at the times indicated for your unique number. Although there are lab sessions
scheduled every week, there are only six labs scheduled for the semester. For weeks during which
you don’t have labs scheduled, the TA(s) will conduct recitation/review sessions. These are,

essentially, review and problem-solving sessions that will help you solidify your understanding of
the material covered in the course, and also an opportunity for you to ask questions about either
the labs or the material covered in our regular classes.
The instructors for the laboratory component of the class are the TAs/UGAs. All lab issues,
including lab grading, should be discussed with your TA/UGA. Participation in all lab sessions is
required except for documented illness or religious observance approved in advance. Per
University policy, you must notify me of your pending absence at least fourteen days prior to the
date of observance of a religious holy day.
Laboratory sessions will start the week of 01/09/2024. The laboratory manual is available on
Canvas as a pdf file.
Accommodation for Religious Observances: By UT Austin policy, you must notify me of your
pending absence at least fourteen days prior to the date of observance of a religious holy day. If
you must miss a class, an examination, a work assignment, or a project in order to observe religious
holy day, you will be given an opportunity to complete the missed work within a reasonable time
after the absence. If there is uncertainty regarding the precise date of a religious observance due to
lunar cycles, etc., you still must inform me at least 14 days prior to the earliest possible date of the
observance and provide the probable range of dates for the observance.
Students with Disabilities: The University of Texas at Austin provides upon request appropriate
academic accommodations for qualified students with disabilities. For more information, contact
the Office of Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD). Additional information on this subject
is posted on the UT Austin web site at https://diversity.utexas.edu/disability/. If you feel you may
be entitled to accommodation under these policies, please consult with the appropriate offices early
in the semester. Evaluation and approval take time, and typical adjustments cannot be applied
retroactively.
Sources of Help: Like most engineering, science, and math courses, ECE 411 builds knowledge
in a rapid step-by-step process throughout the semester. Each step assumes you have mastered the
prior material. If you fall behind by even a few days, it can be difficult to catch up. If you do not
understand something, ask questions in class, come to office hours, and/or take advantage of the
other sources of help that are available. Get help quickly; do not wait! UT also provides resources
to help you with nonacademic issues. A search of the UT website is often a good place to start.
The best way to get help from the instructor is during office hours. If you are not able to make it
to my scheduled office hours, I am often available at my office on the EER 4.864. If you would
like to meet outside scheduled office hours, it is generally best to arrange a time and location with
me in advance. Email is typically the best way to reach me. Please mention ECE 411 in the subject
of any email.

The ECE Undergraduate Student Advising Office in EER is the best place to start if you have
issues related to advising, registration, add/drop, or issues with the UT bureaucracy in general.
The Engineering Student Services and Advising (ESSA) Office in ESS can assist with many issues.
Their web page is http://www.engr.utexas.edu/academics/undergraduate-education/academic-
advising.
Emergency Preparedness and Classroom Evacuation Instructions: Every member of the
university community must take appropriate and deliberate action when an emergency strikes a
building, a portion of the campus, or entire campus community. Emergency preparedness means
we are all ready to act for our own safety and the safety of others during a crisis. It takes an effort
by all of us to create and sustain an effective emergency preparedness system. Information on
emergency preparedness is posted on the class Canvas site. In addition, specific instructions
provided to us on classroom evacuations is included just below for your reference.
Classroom Evacuation for Students: All occupants of university buildings are required to
evacuate a building when a fire alarm and/ or an official announcement is made indicating a
potentially dangerous situation within the building.
Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of each classroom and building you may occupy.
Remember that the nearest exit door may not be the one you used when entering the building.
If you require assistance in evacuation, inform your instructor in writing during the first week of
class.
For evacuation in your classroom or building:
1. Follow the instructions of faculty and teaching staff.
2. Exit in an orderly fashion and assemble outside.
3. Do not re-enter a building unless given instructions by emergency personnel.
