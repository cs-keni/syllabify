Learning Outcomes
ThiscourseaimstobuildonthefoundationalmathematicalideasfromMath231,includinglogic,languageof
sets and functions, mathematical proofs, and recursive algorithms. It also develops important new concepts
and tools, including the theory of linear recurrence relations via generating functions, and some of the
combinatorial mathematics arising from graphs and trees. A successful student should:
(cid:136) consolidate the accurate usage of the language of mathematics initiated in Math 231;
(cid:136) gain more proof-writing experience and see some more significant proofs in the various applications;
(cid:136) learn new tools for solving recurrence relations and gain more familiarity with the method of proof by
induction;
(cid:136) understand some of the mathematics of networks, graphs, planar graphs and trees
Text
Rosen, Discrete Mathematics and Applications, 7th or 8th ed. Homework will be posted on Canvas, so the
text isn’t strictly required, but is recommended as a resource.
Homework
Homework will typically be due once a week, by the beginning of class on Tuesdays. All assignments will be
postedonCanvas. Youshouldwrite(ortype)upyoursolutionsneatlyonaseparatepagefromtheproblem
statements and submit them on Canvas (pdf is the safest choice, but any format that can be opened in the
Canvas grader will be accepted).
Exams
There will be two 50-minute midterm exams, given during class time on Tuesday, October 17 (Week 4) and
Thursday, November 9 (Week 7). There will also be a cumulative two-hour final exam from 2:45-4:45 on
Tuesday, December 5 in our usual classroom.
Absences
Attendanceisnotmandatedexceptontheaboveexamdates. Ifyoumissclass,youshouldfirstborrownotes
from a classmate, then set up a meeting with me if you have further questions about the missed content.
Apart from absences due to university-sanctioned events, I am not permitted to distinguish between “ex-
cused” and “unexcused” absences. Because of this, I am not able to give makeup exams. To mitigate the

it with your final exam score (if this works in your favor).

Grading
Course grades are weighted according to the following scheme:
Homework 20%
Midterm Exams 25% each
Final Exam 30%
Standard grade assignments will be made (i.e. grades in the 80% to 90% range are B’s, those in the 70% to
80% range are C’s, and so on). A+ grades are awarded at my discretion to students who have excelled in all
aspects of the course. Other plus and minus grades will be awarded in the upper and lower 3% of a bracket
(e.g. a grade of B+ is awarded between 87% and 90%; B- between 80% and 83%). I reserve the right to
apply a course adjustment to grades at the end of the term.

General University Policies
The following are standard university policies, not specific to this class.
Academic Misconduct: The University Student Conduct Code, available at
https://conduct.uoregon.edu,
defines academic misconduct. Students are prohibited from committing or attempting to commit any act
that constitutes academic misconduct. By way of example, students should not give or receive (or attempt
to give or receive) unauthorized help on assignments or examinations without express permission from the
instructor. Students should properly acknowledge and document all sources of information (e.g. quotations,
paraphrases, ideas) and use only the sources and resources authorized by the instructor. If there is any
question about whether an act constitutes academic misconduct, it is the students’ obligation to clarify the
question with the instructor before committing or attempting to commit the act. Additional information
about a common form of academic misconduct, plagiarism, is available at
https://researchguides.uoregon.edu/citing-plagiarism.
Accessible Education: The University of Oregon is working to create inclusive learning environments.
Please notify me if there are aspects of the instruction or design of this course that result in disability-
related barriers to your participation. You are also encouraged to contact the Accessible Education Center
in 360 Oregon Hall at 541-346-1155 or uoaec@uoregon.edu.
Accommodation for Religious Observances: The university makes reasonable accommodations, upon
request, for students who are unable to attend a class for religious obligations or observance reasons, in
accordance with the university discrimination policy which says “Any student who, because of religious
beliefs, is unable to attend classes on a particular day shall be excused from attendance requirements and

from any examination or other assignment on that day. The student shall make up the examination or
other assignment missed because of the absence.” To request accommodations for this course for religious
observance, visit the Office of the Registrar’s website
https://registrar.uoregon.edu/calendars/religious-observances
and complete and submit to the instructor the “Student Religious Accommodation Request” form prior to
the end of the second week of the term.
Basic Needs: Any student who has difficulty affording groceries or accessing sufficient food to eat every
day, or who lacks a safe and stable place to live and believes this may affect their performance in the course
is urged to contact the Dean of Students Office (346-3216, 164 Oregon Hall) for support. This UO webpage
includes resources for food, housing, healthcare, childcare, transportation, technology, finances, and legal
support:
https://blogs.uoregon.edu/basicneeds/food.
Inclement Weather: It is generally expected that class will meet unless the University is officially closed
for inclement weather. If it becomes necessary to cancel class while the University remains open, this will
be announced on Canvas and by email. Updates on inclement weather and closure are also communicated
in other ways described here:
https://hr.uoregon.edu/about-hr/campus-notifications/inclement-weather.
MentalHealthandWellness: Lifeatcollegecanbeverycomplicated. Studentsoftenfeeloverwhelmedor
stressed,experienceanxietyordepression,strugglewithrelationships,orjustneedhelpnavigatingchallenges
in their life. If you’re facing such challenges, you don’t need to handle them on your own–there’s help and
support on campus.
As your instructor if I believe you may need additional support, I will express my concerns, the reasons for
them, and refer you to resources that might be helpful. It is not my intention to know the details of what
might be bothering you, but simply to let you know I care and that help is available. Getting help is a
courageous thing to do—for yourself and those you care about.
University Health Services help students cope with difficult emotions and life stressors. If you need general
resources on coping with stress or want to talk with another student who has been in the same place as you,
visit the Duck Nest (located in the EMU on the ground floor) and get help from one of the specially trained
Peer Wellness Advocates. Find out more at health.uoregon.edu/ducknest.
University Counseling Services (UCS) has a team of dedicated staff members to support you with your
concerns, many of whom can provide identity-based support. All clinical services are free and confidential.
