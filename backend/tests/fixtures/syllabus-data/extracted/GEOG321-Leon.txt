GEOG 321: Climatology
Winter 2024, 2:00–3:20p, M & W; Lawrence 166 (CRN 22241)
Instructor: John Christian, jchr@uoregon.edu, OH: Th 2–3p, or by appointment. Condon Hall, 173.
GE: James Maze, jmaze@uoregon.edu, OH: T 1–2p, or by appointment. Condon Hall, 165.
Overview: The climate system is a set of environmental systems including the atmosphere, ocean, and
biosphere, that are coupled to one another and vary over time and space, and climatology is the study of
that system. This course covers the basics of energy and moisture in the climate system, atmospheric
circulation processes and patterns, and the spatial and temporal variations of climate, including those
produced by human action. The course will also trace the development of our understanding of the
physical basis of climatology, the development of conceptual and numerical models of climate, and how
complex systems like the Earth’s climate system are studied.
Learning objectives: The goal of this course is to provide an intermediate-level understanding of (and
appreciation for) weather and climate systems. A further goal is to advance students' understanding of
several cross-cutting concepts in geography and Earth Science, as well as some transferrable practical
skills. The general concepts include:
Understanding fundamental controls and responses in environmental systems, such as
conservation principles, and tendencies towards equilibrium.
Using a hierarchy of models (e.g. conceptual to mechanistic) to understand environmental systems
at a range of scales.
Understanding how remote/ultimate causes can govern local/proximate responses.
Practical skills include:
The use of Internet information sources to “diagnose” the controls of current environmental
conditions
Interpreting multivariate data presented in a range of ways (e.g., altitude vs. pressure coordinates;
geographic vs. temporal means)
How the course works (materials and activities): The main information sources in this course are: 1)
PowerPoint slides that show the key figures and ideas on what the climate system is and how it works; 2)
Readings posted to the Canvas page; and 3) online sources of current and historical weather and climate
data, which will demonstrate how the climate system is working in "real time" and over the recent past.
Topics are organized by weeks, with one outline, PowerPoint, and readings used for the whole week.
There will be two assignments (an exercise and a “weather report”) and a quiz each week. Canvas will be
used to post lecture outlines, readings, slide images, and URLs, as well as the links to the assignments
and quizzes. Please note: It is my aim to adhere to the schedule and structure of assigments stated here,
but I reserve the right to make changes to the syllabus if conditions require. Any such changes will be
communicated in class and on Canvas.
The exercises and “weather reports” (one of each, every week) are designed to reinforce the
understanding that can be gained from looking at the current weather and archived climate data;

exercises may also focus on synthesizing key concepts presented in lectures. The visual inspection and
interpretation of the maps and images will be important, but accommodation for alternative methods of
course-material access may be possible–please let us know as soon as possible. More info on
accomodations is provided below.
The weather reports will often involve looking at the weather data sometime between Friday and Monday
each week and answering a couple of questions. If a distinct weather event is forecast, it may be
necessary to look at the weather data over a particular interval, after which the questions will become
more difficult to answer. It is thus recommended to look at the weather report assignment shortly after it
is posted Friday to see if there is a particular “target” time to focus on. Weather reports may also focus on
"breaking" climate-science results and reports. In sum, they are an opportunity to engage with the current
state of the natural climate system, and the state of climate science.
Exercises and weather reports should be written in full sentences, with proper grammar, and use of
course-related vocabulary when appropriate.
Text: No required textbook; assigned readings will be posted as .pdfs and URLs on Canvas, including
links to current assessments of climate variations. However, some recommended supplemental
references are available as eBooks from the UO library: Atmosphere, Weather & Climate (Barry, Chorley
and Serreze, 2009) [link] provides a comprehensive overview; Global Physical Climatology (Hartmann,
2015) [link] is an excellent advanced but readable text ; The Encyclopedia of Atmospheric Sciences (2nd
Ed) [link] provides further technical information.
Websites: Canvas is the central hub for this course; however we will also make frequent use of web
resources, including:
The UO Current Weather and Climate page, maintained by UO Prof. Pat Bartlein:
https://pjbartlein.github.io/UOCWC/
The NOAA Climate Monitoring portal: http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/climate-monitoring/
Technical Requirements: You will need access to the internet, to UO’s Canvas site, and to a browser
and word processing or text-editing software on a notebook or desktop computer. Although it might be
technically possible to do some of the exercises and weather reports using a phone or tablet, it is likely to
be tedious as many weather/climate data pages are not optimized for phones; using a computer is
recommended. If you have questions about accessing and using Canvas, visit the Canvas Support for
Students page. If you face Internet access challenges, computer labs are open for students on campus.
Prerequisites: Geog 141 (or similar introductory Earth-system science course, with consent of instructor)
Grading: 100 points total. Ten quizzes (in Canvas, 4 points each, 40 pts. total for the quizzes), ten
exercises that involve the analysis of online data or synthesis of concepts from lecture (4 points each, 40
points total for the exercises), and ten “weather reports” (2 points each, 20 points total). The quiz
questions will consist of a mix of multiple-choice and short-answer questions, will emphasize concepts
(as opposed to factoids), and will also include questions aimed at your ability a) to synthesize material
presented in the lectures, readings, and related web pages, and b) to interpret climate data in various
forms (e.g., weather maps, time series). Quizzes will be posted on Mondays and must be completed by
Wednesday evening. The grade cutoffs will be (lower bounds):
A+ A A- B+ B B- C+ C C- D+ D
98 93 90 87 83 80 77 73 70 65 60

Do not use ChatGPT for answers. There is plenty of information in the course materials and links. For this
class, copying responses from ChatGPT (or similar AI) will be considered misconduct.
Late work: The quizzes will have specific “hard” due dates, listed in Canvas, and cannot be completed
late. However, to build in some flexibility, the lowest quiz score (from a missed quiz or otherwise) will be
"dropped". Exercises and weather reports also should be submitted by the times listed in Canvas. One
point will be deducted for late submissions. The easiest way to lose points is through simple lateness in
the submission of exercises and weather reports or in the completion of quizzes. If extenuating
circumstances come up, get in touch, and we can make a plan. The official policy regarding
"Incompletes" can be found here.
Attendance: While attendence isn't a formal part of the grade, it is important for overall success in the
course and synthesizing the range of topics we will cover. As interesting weather/climate events arise this
winter, we may spend considerable class time looking at real-time data and this may be difficult to
reconstruct later. Lecture slides will be posted on Canvas, though this is not a full replacement for the
delivered lecture. So if you do miss class, try to follow up with classmates or visit our office hours soon to
fill in the gaps. For illness, family-related, or personal issues, let us know, and we can work out a plan for
catching up. Please stay home and rest if you are sick!
University policies on religious accommodation, accessible education, and university-sponsored activities
will be followed (see sections below for more detail).

Communicating with instructors: Announcements will be posted on the Canvas site. We will also
monitor a Canvas discussion area for practical and topical questions. If something isn't making sense or
there are issues acessing online data sources, it's likely others have the same question so this is a helpful
place to post such issues. For other questions about course content, or personal/time sensitive issues,
reach out via email or come to office hours. I will try to respond within a business day. I enjoy discussing
climatology, and I want you to learn and succeed in the course, so please don't hesitate to come to office
hours! I am also available by appointment outside of the regular office hourse; just email me to schedule.

Classroom community expectations: Standard, respectful classroom behavior is expected, and
extends to Canvas and in office hours. Expect and respect diversity of backgrounds and perspectives;
help each other learn; be kind and curious. We may occasionally have breakouts to discuss ideas or look
at data with your neighbors; please be engaged and inclusive during these times. Otherwise, generally
avoid disruption in class so that others can focus. That said, questions during lectures are encouraged!
Academic dishonesty policies will be enforced (more below). You are welcome to collaborate on Exercises
and Weather Reports, provided your answers are constructed independently. You are not allowed to
collaborate on quizzes. Computers are welcome for notetaking and viewing course-related material. Other
use of laptops, tablets, and phones in class may be distracting to your classmates and is considered
unprofessional. Unless prior arrangements have been made, please do not record video or audio in class.
Expanded course description: The climate system is a set of environmental systems including the
atmosphere, ocean, biosphere, cryosphere, hydrosphere, and lithosphere. These systems are coupled to
one another and vary over time and space, and climatology is the study of that coupled system. Climate
variations occur on a wide range of temporal and spatial scales, and have many drivers, including:
changes in Earth’s orbit and solar radiation; geologic controls on atmospheric composition and the
arrangement of continents; intrinsic fluctuations in atmosphere and ocean circulation (i.e., weather); and
human impacts on atmospheric composition and the land surface. Understanding how the climate
system works therefore requires input from across the environmental sciences, and because human
activities clearly influence climate, is also connected to the social sciences.
The first part of the course examines the basic controls of and variations in energy and moisture in the
climate system, and describes their temporal and spatial variations. The middle part of the course
examines atmospheric circulation, its maintenance, and role in redistributing energy and moisture around
the globe, as well as the connection between larger-scale atmospheric circulation features and the
seasonal and day-to-day variations of weather at a place. The third part of the course examines the
spatial and temporal variations of climate, including the global and regional variations of weather and
climate, climate history on multiple time scales, and modern anthropogenic climate change.
We will also trace the development of our understanding of how the climate system works via the
progressive elaboration of simple models of the atmosphere and climate into the conceptual models that
underly the connection between large-scale circulation features and surface conditions, and the
numerical models that are used for day-to-day weather forecasting and for projecting future climate
changes.
Core Education Requirements: This course is designated as a Natural Science Core Education course.
At UO, core education is designed to provide a broad, interdisciplinary education that helps students,
think critically and creatively, communicate clearly, and reflect ethically. Specifically, in this class, you will
learn and practice:
Critical thinking, where some examples of topics include:
Using evidence to draw conclusions: Exercises and Weather Reports will frequently call for looking
at online sources of model output and/or climate observations, in order to draw conclusions about
current conditions or changes in time.
Modeling: The output of numerical models of the atmosphere are examined frequently in lecture.
As the course progresses, we will be able to tie more and more “observables” to our mechanistic
understanding of climate.
Influence of context or underlying assumptions: for example, comparing distinct, imperfect
sources of information such as weather radar, which is a direct observation of precipitation, but

subject to systematic errors, versus forecast-model output, which is physics-based, but subject to
the growth of errors over time.
Creative thinking, where some examples include:
Acquiring strategies and skills: By the end of course, through daily exposure and the exercises,
students will be able to interpret real-time satellite imagery, numerical weather forecasting output,
and current “state-of-the-climate” analyses.
Going beyond the course material: The “Weather Report” exercises typically have a “exact”
question, and a “what do you think?” question. An example would be reflecting on the
effectiveness of different forecast types, and on uncertainties in weather forecasts and climate
projections.
Written communication
Although not the major focus of the course, written communication is emphasized in assignemnts.
We will ask for full, coherent sentences, and encourage using terms that otherwise would be
regarded as jargon, but in the context of the exercises allow for efficient expression of technical
concepts.

Mental health and wellbeing Life at college can be very complicated. Students often feel overwhelmed
or stressed, experience anxiety or depression, struggle with relationships, or just need help navigating
challenges in their life. If you're facing such challenges, you don't need to handle them on your own--
there's help and support on campus. As your instructor if I believe you may need additional support, I will
express my concerns, the reasons for them, and refer you to resources that might be helpful. It is not my
intention to know the details of what might be bothering you, but simply to let you know I care and that
help is available. Getting help is a courageous thing to do—for yourself and those you care about.
University Health Services helps students cope with difficult emotions and life stressors. If you need
general resources on coping with stress or want to talk with another student who has been in the same
place as you, visit the Duck Nest (located in the EMU on the ground floor) and get help from one of the
specially trained Peer Wellness Advocates. University Counseling Services (UCS) has a team of dedicated
staff members to support you with your concerns, many of whom can provide identity-based support. All
clinical services are free and confidential. Find out more at counseling.uoregon.edu or by calling 541-346-
3227 (anytime UCS is closed, the After-Hours Support and Crisis Line is available by calling this same
number).
Academic disruption due to campus emergency: In the event of a campus emergency that disrupts
academic activities, course requirements, deadlines, and grading percentages are subject to change.
Information about changes in this course will be communicated as soon as possible by email, and on
Canvas. If we are not able to meet face-to-face, students should immediately log onto Canvas and read
any announcements and/or access alternative assignments. Students are also expected to continue
coursework as outlined in this syllabus or other instructions on Canvas.
Inclement weather: (Stay safe and take notes!) It is generally expected that class will meet unless the
University is officially closed for inclement weather. If it becomes necessary to cancel class while the
University remains open, this will be announced on Canvas and by email. Updates on inclement weather
and closure are also communicated as described on the Inclement Weather webpage.
