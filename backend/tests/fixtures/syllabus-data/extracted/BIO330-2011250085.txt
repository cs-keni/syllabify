QUESTIONS:
Questions during class periods and during office hours are encouraged. If you
cannot attend regularly scheduled office hours, please CALL or SEND E-MAIL FIRST to
make an appointment. Please make use of electronic mail for questions
(mmtv@mail.utexas.edu). It is an excellent way to think through problems that you may
have encountered with the lecture material and, often, you may receive the answer
faster than through an appointment. There also is a Discussion Board on the web site
that can be used to post questions and allow discussion among members of the class.
EXAMS AND GRADING:
Two exams will be given during the regularly scheduled class period in JGB 2.218
and a comprehensive final exam will be given on Thursday, May 12. Each of the
regularly scheduled exams will count as 25% of your grade, and there will be several
quizzes during class periods that will make up the remaining 25%. There are no make-
ups for quizzes, but you will be allowed to drop one grade. Make-up exams are given
only under RARE circumstances and MUST BE accompanied by written documentation
of the absence and after approval from the instructor. Each regularly scheduled exam
will be in a short answer/essay format and will cover lectures and assigned reading
material from the part of the course immediately preceding each exam. Exams will be
given according to the syllabus schedule unless there is an official University holiday.
Approximate letter grades will be given for each exam. These grades should only be
considered as general indicators of your progress and not as formal partial grades.
Exams usually are graded within one week and will be returned during class periods
(except the final exam). Cheating WILL NOT be tolerated under any circumstances, and
all exams are copied before they are returned. Therefore, there is a written record of all
responses during the exam period. Re-grading of exams will be considered only by
returning the exam with a WRITTEN explanation to the grader in my mailbox located in
the Microbiology office (NMS 2.104). Exams will be considered for re-grading only until
another regularly scheduled exam is given; this means that you have about a month and
a half to have re-grades performed.
STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES
Please notify me during the first two weeks of class of any modification/adaptation
that you may require to accommodate a need related to your disability. You will be
requested to provide documentation to the Office of the Dean of Students so that the
most appropriate accommodations can be determined. Specialized services are
available on campus through Service for Students with Disabilities.
READING MATERIAL:
The recommended reading material has been cited from the textbook “Fundamentals
of Molecular Virology” by Nicholas H. Acheson (available from the University Co-op or
amazon.com). This book is on reserve in the Science library. Other recommended
textbooks are Genes X by B. Lewin (www.ergito.com), Fundamental Virology (4th ed.)
by David Knipe and Peter M. Howley, Principles of Virology by S. J. Flint et al. (3rd ed.),
Virology: Principles and Applications by John Carter (2007), and Virology: Molecular
Biology and Pathogenesis by Leonard Norkin (2010). Some of these recommended
textbooks are on reserve in the Science library.
