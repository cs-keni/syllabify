CS 346 - Cryptography (Spring 2015)
The objective of this course is to familiarize
the students with cryptography and its
applications. Topics will include historical
cryptography, encryption, authentication ,
public key cryptography, number theory.
This class will focus on understanding the
theoretical underpinnings of cryptography.
Course
Key components of this course are
Overview
understanding how to precisely formulate
security definitions and how to rigoursly
prove theorems. This course is designed to be
a challenging theory course. A good
background and comfort in classes such as
CS331 is important. A large component will
be problems sets. These sets are meant to
develop problem solving skills.
