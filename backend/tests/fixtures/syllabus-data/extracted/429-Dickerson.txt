COURSE:
Systems 1: Computer Organization and Architecture
DESCRIPTION:
The first course in the Systems series helps students understand the basic operation of computing
hardware, how it works, and how it interfaces to software. Upon completing this course, students
should have a high-level understanding of the role played by compilers, assemblers, instruction sets,
and hardware. Students will also learn system-level programming and apply their knowledge of
computer architectures to programming for performance.

LABS
The following classrooms are used for weekly lab meetings with your TA. Please attend the lab
meeting that your section is registered for because this is where the TAs will hand back exams and
other material.
(51775) PAR 301 - 10:00 AM to 12 PM - Kai
(51780) PAR 201 - 12:00 PM to 2 PM - Lijia
(51785) GDC 5.302 - 2:00 PM to 4 PM - Lijia
(51790) WAG 214 - 9:00 AM to 11 AM - Keshav
(51795) BUR 224 - 11:00 AM to 1 PM - Keshav
(51800) WEL 2.256 - 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM - Kai
The lab session is normally divided into two parts, the first hour and the second hour. The first hour is
lead by the TA to introduce the biweekly lab that has been assigned and any lecture that he or she has
prepared. The second hour is used to discuss problem sets that you would like to work on (like office
hours).

STUDENT EVALUATION
Your performance in this class will be evaluated through participation, 4 homework assignments, 6
laboratory assignments, 3 midterm exams, and a final exam. It is best to assume there will be no
"curving" these scores. The weights of each of these components is listed below:
• Exams: 50%
• Laboratory Assignments: 40%
• Homeworks: 5%
• Class participation: 5%
LAB ASSIGNMENTS
There are 7 laboratory assignments, scheduled roughly every 2 weeks. Laboratory assignments are
due at 9 AM on the Friday that it is due. Programming components of the laboratory assignments
must be tarballed and submitted electronically through Canvas. You may not email your assignments
to the teaching staff since Canvas helps us organize submissions better. Programs will be graded on
correctness, readability, style, documentation, and performance. You must work alone on these
assignments, without collaboration.
• Lab 0 - Linked List in C - Using Linux, programming and compiling in C
• Lab 1 - Data Lab - using bit arithmetic to solve problems
• Lab 2 - Y86 programming - write programs in Assembly
• Lab 3 - Defusing a Bomb - reverse engineering to diffuse Dr. Evil's bomb
• Lab 4 - Buffer bomb - stop Dr. Evil from reaching into bad memory addresses
• Lab 5 - Extending the Machine - Add new instructions to a processor
• Lab 6 - Improving performance - improve the performance of a pipelined processor
EXAMS
There are 4 exams during the term, scheduled roughly every month. The 3 midterms during the course
term evaluate your understanding of new material. The final exam is comprehensive and tests your
understanding of the totality of the course. The exams are closed-book and closed-notes. No
electronic devices are necessary to solve the problems, and reference sheets will be printed out to
assist your memory over ISA's and other material. When we hand out the exams, we must
unfortunately have them handed back in order to prevent exams floating around on the black market.
You should in most cases take your midterm during the lecture session you are registered for,
however in some cases, you may take the exam in the lecture you have been attending regularly. If this
relaxed policy becomes a problem, I might restrict this in future exams. The current midterm dates are
the following. Assuming we keep up with schedule, they will be:
Midterm 1 ( C Programming + Bits and Bytes) , March 2
Midterm 2 ( Assembly Programming ), March 30
Midterm 3 ( Datapath + Pipelining), April 27
Final Exam (Comprehensive + Caching), TBA

HOMEWORKS
There are only 4 homework assignments which are challenging and helps solidify your knowledge.
Most problems come from the book, with other supplementary problems added. You must prepare
your solutions as a PDF document, and upload it to Canvas on the Thursday in which it is due. You
might want to use LaTeX for typesetting your document. You may work with friends on this
assignment.
PARTICIPATION
Attending every lecture is important for understanding the material. In order to make the lecture more
exciting, I will be asking questions intermittently when presenting new information. Since we are in a
large classroom, we will be using the iClickr device to tally your responses to the problem. The
accuracy of the responses may or may not have an impact on your participation score, however
participation is important for me to know if I should slow down and explain how a problem should be
answered.
You should actively participate in Piazza. It's not only for posting questions you have, but also posting
answers to your classmates' questions. If you discover something interesting, such as a vulnerability
in the Linux kernel or something that's relevant, please share it. Your participation on Piazza can be
tracked with stats about how often you respond to questions and it could have an impact positively on
your participation score.
HOW TO DO WELL IN THIS COURSE:
• Show up punctually and consistently for the lectures and laboratory sections.
• Find friends to study with. Work on practice problems together, or better yet, pick a problem
and then teach each other how to solve it.
• Check Canvas frequently for latest course announcements and information
• Submit questions and respond to other student's questions on Piazza. Engage the material and
ask things or share new things you learned on Piazza as well.
• Get familiar with the GNU/Linux environment. Get a department account, and start learning the
Unix operating system sufficiently well to meet the demands of the course (gcc, gdb, emacs, vi,
make, etc). Install Linux in a virtual machine or on a partition on your personal computer. You
can find many GNU/Linux guides online.
• Do the posted readings on time. Although the book is good, it is quite dense in material and a
bit dry. Pacing your readings will help with retention. Complete all the practice problems when
you read, and check your answer in the back on the chapter.
• Doing well in this course requires a strong dedication to learning the material and may require
a substantial time commitment to complete the programming assignments. Start early, and
seek help!
