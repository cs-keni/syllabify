LEARNING OBJECTIVES
BA 324 focuses on writing, speaking, and interpersonal communication. Although differences in instructors’ presentation
styles are a natural and valuable part of a multi-section course, all sections of BA 324 have the same objectives.
These objectives specify that business students, at the conclusion of the course, should be able to:
1. Analyze communication situations to make choices about the most effective methods of delivery.
2. Analyze audiences to make choices about the most effective methods of communicating messages.
3. Conduct research using electronic library and Internet resources.
4. Write and orally deliver research-based reports.
5. Use extemporaneous and/or impromptu oral presentations skills effectively.
6. Provide, accept, and incorporate feedback to improve written and oral communication.
7. Write business documents that are grammatically correct and use appropriate business style and format.
8. Develop and demonstrate effective interpersonal communication skills.
9. Use communication technology appropriately and effectively.
Instructor Communication
Instructors use email and Canvas to communicate with students. Students must use their UT email for all
assignments and correspondence in class. Email requests from non-university email accounts will be
ignored. Students are responsible for checking their university-registered email accounts regularly. Emails from
instructors can contain important information about the course. When emailing, please use proper business etiquette;
include a greeting, subject line, clear request, and closing. Emails are typically answered within 24 hours during the business
week. Do not expect a reply after-hours.

COURSE MODE and COMMUNICATION POLICIES
BA324 teaches developmental business writing and presentation skills. Assignments scaffold and build on each other and are
framed using the 3x3 writing process from your text.
We meet in person two days a week unless you are notified otherwise. Occasionally a class will be held virtually via Zoom.
Notice will be sent, and an announcement posted on Canvas, when/if class mode changes.
VERY IMPORTANT ABOUT COURSE MODE
You are expected to adhere to the course modes. Though this is an in-person course, we may meet online on some days.
Some days will be lectures, and others will be presentations. There may be days that you will be assigned to work with your
group on specific projects or to watch a recorded lecture/presentation and respond in a discussion posting or another form of
response. Your presence, regardless of course mode, is required to be counted Present.
Getting Help with Zoom—Assuming the use of Zoom is necessary
Students needing help with Zoom should refer to the McCombs Student Instructional Wiki for a set of comprehensive
instructions. All McCombs Canvas course pages have this link on the left menu bar for quick and easy reference.
UT Zoom Account
All students must use a UT Zoom account to participate in classes, office hours if remotely scheduled, and any UT affiliated
events. For detailed instructions on how to sign up for a UT Zoom account, see Getting Started with Zoom. You will be
denied access to Zoom sessions if you attempt to access without a valid UT account.
Joining a Class or Office Hours in Zoom
The preferred method of joining a class or office hours is through Canvas using your UT email account. Students, using their
UT email account, must log into their Canvas course site and click on Zoom on the left menu bar to locate links to join the
class in Zoom in the calendar on Canvas. Zoom links for a class or office hours may also be emailed by the instructor.
Regardless, students must use their UT Zoom account to participate. For information, see How to Join Class or Office Hours.
BA324 Syllabus EHS Spring 2024 Page 3

Zoom Professionalism and Etiquette
Following are some best practices for making sure we are working together to create an efficient, effective, respectful, and
ultimately enjoyable classroom when accessing remotely:
• Always keep your video on.
• Dress professionally.
• Be mindful of your surroundings when on camera to minimize distractions.
• Avoid display of inappropriate materials or expressions, either visual, textual, or otherwise. Such displays may be
subject to disciplinary action.
• Turn your camera off when leaving the meeting temporarily and use the away feedback icon.
• Include a professional photo of yourself for your Zoom profile picture. This photo will be visible during class sessions
when you take brief breaks and turn off your video.
• Mute yourself unless you are speaking. This will reduce background or feedback noise and limit distractions.
• Pose questions or comments using the “raise” your hand feature or typing in the chat window.
• Restart your computer if the video or audio is choppy. Here are some other tips: Internet Connection Tips.
• Use the most reliable WIFI you can access. If you experience problems with your connection, check the above tips.
For more information, please see Zoom Etiquette.
AI Use in Coursework
Artificial Intelligence applications are quickly evolving as useful business tools. As with any tech tool, we must consider
how to use AI appropriately and ethically. The university has created an acceptable use policy, found here. See COURSE
POLICIES below for specific information about this section of BA324.
Notetaking
Use your text-based resources for preparing for class. Enter Mindtap within Cengage to access an abundance of student
tools including flashcards and slides. In class, please either type or handwrite your notes. Do not use your camera
or phone as a replacement for taking notes. No instructor notes and/or PPTs will be shared.
Cell Phones and Laptops
This is a very interactive and collaborative course; thus, I will not allow cell phone use during class. I will give you a warning, and
if you persist, you could be counted as absent for the day. If there is a compelling reason for you to have your cell phone available
during class (family emergency or the like), please let me know before class and keep the phone on vibrate.
I will also restrict the use of laptops to exams, class activities, and note-taking. If I see that you are using your laptop for other
purposes during class, I will give you a warning. If you persist after a warning, you could be counted as absent for that day. It's
important to remember that if you are watching YouTube videos of kittens during class, everyone behind you is, too.
Sharing of Course Materials is Prohibited
No materials used in this class, including, but not limited to, lecture hand-outs, videos, assessments (quizzes, exams,
papers, projects, homework assignments), in-class materials, review sheets, and additional problem sets, may be shared
online or with anyone outside of the class unless you have my explicit, written permission. Unauthorized sharing of
materials promotes cheating. It is a violation of the University’s Student Honor Code and an act of academic dishonesty.
Any materials found online that are associated with you, or any suspected unauthorized sharing of materials, will be
reported to Student Conduct and Academic Integrity in the Office of the Dean of Students. These reports can result in
sanctions, including failure in the course.
Class Recordings
Class recordings are reserved only for students in this class for educational purposes and are protected under FERPA. The
recordings should not be shared outside the class in any form. Violation of this restriction by a student could lead to
Student Misconduct proceedings.
CORE COMMUNICATION SKILLS
BA 324 focuses on a core set of communication skills and requires assignments that support students in their learning of
these skills. Students can expect to work on this core set of skills in all sections of BA 324, although individual sections may
add or substitute specific assignments that teach the same skills and fulfill the same course objectives.
BA324 Syllabus EHS Spring 2024 Page 4

These communication skills and the types of assignments that teach those skills are:
Written Communication: Students take notes, keep a journal, write emails, letters, memos, proposals, formal and
informal reports, work plans, and evaluation reports. Students practice writing and grammar.
Oral Communication: Oral presentations from 1-30 minutes long use informative, persuasive, and extemporaneous
methods of delivery. Some oral presentations require the use of visual aids such as handouts and presentation software such
as PowerPoint, Canva, and Prezi.
Time Management: Assignments are varied, integrated, and overlapping, and students must focus on multiple issues,
projects, and demands. Students must, therefore, take responsibility for planning and pacing their own work as well as
developing time management skills. USE AN ELECTRONIC CALENDAR WITH REMINDERS TO STAY ON TRACK.
Group Management: Students work on group projects to develop and practice interpersonal skills by communicating with
group members, other groups, and peers outside the group. Much of this work is done OUTSIDE of class.
Project Development: Groups of approximately four to six students develop projects, complete research, schedule
meetings, write team papers and reports, and deliver a 20-30-minute oral presentation using visual aids. These projects build
on and use the skills developed in other class assignments. Much of this work is done OUTSIDE of class.
Evaluation/feedback: Assignments that require students to learn and develop evaluation and feedback skills are included
throughout the course. These assignments may involve editing one’s own writing and doing self-critiques, self-evaluations, or
analyses of one’s own presentations, interpersonal communication, and other class activities. These assignments may also
involve peer-editing as well as providing evaluations and critiques of the work of other class members.
Interpersonal Skills: Students are part of a network in class and regularly work in teams. Skills developed are
collaboration, teamwork, and effective conflict management. Much of this work is done OUTSIDE of class.
Meeting Management: As part of the projects, groups meet on a regular basis. Skills include developing project plans,
goals, and agendas, providing feedback, and synthesizing and prioritizing tasks and information. Much of this work is done
OUTSIDE of class.
UNIVERSITY POLICIES
Academic Integrity
Each student in the course is expected to abide by the University of Texas Honor Code: “As a student of The University of
Texas at Austin, I shall abide by the core values of the University and uphold academic integrity.” Plagiarism is taken
very seriously at UT. Therefore, if you use words or ideas that are not your own (or that you have used in a previous
class), you must cite your sources. Otherwise, you will be guilty of plagiarism and subject to academic disciplinary action,
including failure of the course. You are responsible for understanding UT’s Academic Honesty and the University Honor
Code which can be found at the following web address:
https://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/conduct/standardsofconduct.php
Policy on scholastic dishonesty
The McCombs School of Business has no tolerance for acts of scholastic dishonesty. The responsibilities of both students and
faculty with regard to scholastic dishonesty are described in detail in the BBA Program’s Statement on Scholastic Dishonesty
at http://my.mccombs.utexas.edu/BBA/Code-of-Ethics. By teaching this course, I have agreed to observe all faculty
responsibilities described there. By enrolling in this class, you have agreed to observe all student responsibilities described
there. If the application of the Statement on Scholastic Dishonesty to this class or its assignments is unclear in any way, it is
your responsibility to ask me for clarification. Students who violate University rules on scholastic dishonesty are subject to
disciplinary penalties, including the possibility of failure in the course and/or dismissal from the University. Since dishonesty
harms the individual, all students, the integrity of the University, and the value of our academic brand, policies on scholastic
dishonesty will be strictly enforced.
You should refer to the Student Judicial Services website at http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/ to access the official
University policies and procedures on scholastic dishonesty as well as further elaboration scholastic dishonesty.
BA324 Syllabus EHS Spring 2024 Page 5

Q drop policy
If you want to drop a class after the 12th class day, you’ll need to execute a Q drop before the Q-drop deadline, which
typically occurs near the middle of the semester. Under Texas law, you are only allowed six Q drops while you are in
college at any public Texas institution. For more information, see:
http://www.utexas.edu/ugs/csacc/academic/adddrop/qdrop
CLASS SUCCESS, GRADING POLICIES, & REQUIRED ASSIGNMENTS INFO
I sincerely want everyone to be successful in this course. However, BA324 is not an easy class, especially since you are
learning new skills which often require that you first UNlearn habits. If, at any time, you are struggling with the course,
please set up a time to meet with me so that we can come up with a plan of action. I am a resource for you; make a habit of
visiting my office hours or checking in with me after class with questions.
The textbook is a valuable and necessary resource for success in BA324. However, I do NOT lecture over the reading;
classroom time is usually spent implementing lecture material. What this means is Do Your Reading in Advance. On
the occasions when I lecture, material will come from various places including the text and any other assigned readings.
You are expected to TAKE NOTES during class. Instructor PPTs and notes are NOT provided. Successful
students use resources and follow the 3x3 writing process, including Phase 1: PREWRITING, Phase 2: DRAFTING, and
most especially Phase 3: REVISING.
The following figure frames the writing and presentation process in BA324 and is worth memorizing:
Figure 2.2 Guffey & Loewy 12th edition
Class Success = Preparation & Participation
Throughout the semester, you are expected to participate, be prepared and professional during class and discussions. What
this means is be active in answering questions, contributing your ideas, completing activities, and reading the assigned
chapters. Your success depends on your engaged effort.
The following behaviors will be considered evidence of your interest in success:
• Having an attitude of learning (more than grade-orientation)
• Attending class and group meetings
• Taking notes during class
• Attending TA office hours
• Completing assignments in preparation for class
• Participating in class discussion and exercises
• Contributing information and ideas that add to the value of class
• Communicating courteously and respectfully to faculty, staff, guest speakers, and peers
BA324 Syllabus EHS Spring 2024 Page 6

• Respecting and celebrating the diversity of others
• Encouraging others by asking questions, allowing others to complete their ideas, and responding appropriately
• Sharing supportive and critical feedback
• Being honest and ethical (i.e., if you do not know something or have not yet completed an assignment, say so!)
• Behaving consistently with expectations (i.e., be on time, stay until end, be prepared, offer constructive feedback)
• Communicating timely notice about absences to peers and instructor via email
• Limiting side-conversations
Class Success = Following McCombs Classroom Professional Standards
The highest professional standards are expected of all members of the McCombs community. The collective class
reputation and the value of the undergraduate program experience hinges on this. Faculty are expected to be professional
and prepared to deliver value for every class session. Students are expected to be professional in all aspects.
The classroom and online experience are enhanced when:
▪ Students arrive on time. On time arrival ensures that classes can start and finish at the scheduled time.
On time arrival shows respect for both fellow students and faculty and it enhances learning by reducing
avoidable distractions.
▪ Students minimize unscheduled personal breaks. The learning environment improves when disruptions
are limited.
▪ Students are fully prepared for each class. Much of the learning in the undergraduate program takes
place during classroom discussions. When students are not prepared, they cannot contribute to the overall
learning process. This affects not only the individual, but their peers who count on them, as well.
▪ Students respect the views and opinions of their colleagues. Disagreement and debate are encouraged.
Intolerance for the views of others is unacceptable.

ASSIGNMENT DETAILS
Exams (2 @ 50 pts each)
You will be examined during Weeks 8 and 16 over the textbook material. USE YOUR e-book resources, including study
guides, practice quizzes, and student PPTs to prepare for these multiple choice, t/f, and fill-in-the-blank 50 question exams.
MindTap Grammar Quizzes (10 @ 5 pts each)
You will access Grammar Quizzes on Canvas under Modules. I recommend that you take the quizzes as soon as possible and
complete all of them in the first few weeks of class since grammar and format are a large part of grading. MindTap quizzes
are all due no later than Week 13. You will have THREE attempts at each quiz but be sure to NOT submit until you have
taken all three tries to achieve the required 89% for passing. In other words, anything less than 89% is a zero; 89% or greater
scores at 100%. If you have any questions, please contact either your grader or Dr. Hanson Smith.
MindTap Information

BA 324: Writing Flag Designation (Substantial Writing Component Course)
This course carries the Writing Flag. Writing Flag courses are designed to give students experience with writing in an
academic discipline. In this class, you can expect to write regularly during the semester, complete substantial writing
projects, and receive feedback from your instructor and your TA to help you improve your writing. You will also have the
opportunity to revise one or more assignments, and you may be asked to read and discuss your peers’ work.
You should therefore expect a substantial portion of your grade to come from your written work.
Writing Flag classes meet the Core Communications objectives of Critical Thinking, Communication, Teamwork, and
Personal Responsibility, established by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board. The Writing Flag faculty committee
also provides statements on Plagiarism and Academic Integrity, Plagiarism Detection Software, and the use of Artificial
Intelligence:
Plagiarism and Academic Integrity
Using someone else’s work in your own writing without giving proper credit is considered plagiarism, a serious form of
academic dishonesty that can result in severe penalties. Copying someone else’s work, buying a paper and submitting it as
your own, copying and pasting text (even with changes), or borrowing images from an online source, are some examples of
plagiarism. Even if you plagiarize accidentally, you can be held responsible and penalized.
Learning to cite sources appropriately is an important part of becoming a professional. When you are unsure about citation,
you are encouraged to ask your instructor (who is already an expert in the discipline) what is appropriate in the context of
your assignment. Consultants at The University Writing Center can also help you determine whether you are citing sources
correctly—and they have helpful guides online for using direct quotations and paraphrasing. Reviewing those skills will help
you feel confident that you are handling sources professionally in your writing.
You can read the University’s definition of plagiarism and other forms of academic dishonesty in Sec. 11–402 of the Student
Conduct Code. For more information, visit the Dean of Students’ site.
BA324 Syllabus EHS Spring 2024 Page 10

Artificial Intelligence
You can find the Writing Flag faculty committee’s statement on use of Artificial Intelligence in Writing Flag courses here.
See Dr. HS’s policy below.
CLASSROOM POLICIES
Assignment Progression
All BA 324 assignments build on one another. What this means is that the assignments will become increasingly
difficult during the semester, and you may not master one skill before being introduced to another. The psychology of
becoming “unconsciously competent” (knowing your material so well you don’t have to think about it), takes time, practice,
and correction. Be patient with yourself and do not expect to be good at something you are just learning. I promise you will
get lots of feedback this semester to improve your writing and speaking. In other words, EXPECT to be satisfactory (which
translates to a C on assignments)!
AI Use in Coursework
Artificial Intelligence applications are quickly evolving as useful business tools. As with any tech tool, we must consider
how to use AI appropriately and ethically. The university has created an acceptable use policy, found here.
In this section of BA324, we will use AI tools such as ChatGPT to conduct routine research queries and generate first
drafts of writing projects. The end goal of using a tool such as ChatGPT is to brainstorm ideas, pull existing data, and
organize ideas into logical order. Used this way, AI tools are excellent resources that optimize time management and
idea generation.
However, AI use is limited to what exists in unvetted databases and is unable to critically evaluate its output. YOUR
VALUE is that you are human and capable of higher order thinking. The HUMAN element of the writing process is
CRITICAL THINKING and REASONING. Being the ‘human in the loop’ means considering some questions:
• Is the information accurate?

All submission must be in your own writing. When you use AI during the production of your work, you must
upload your transcript. Include the prompts you used to query the tool. Save all material generated by AI tools
(BA324.Section_AI-use_AssignName_YourLastName), which you will submit as part of your draft process. You are fully
responsible for all work submitted, including content and resources generated by AI that may be fabricated or invented.
CHECK YOUR WORK and SOURCES carefully.
Students are not permitted to use AI to generate answers to exams. Violations of this policy will be treated as academic
misconduct. If you have any questions about this policy or if you are unsure whether a particular use of AI is acceptable,
please do not hesitate to ask for clarification.
Assignment Submission/Late Work Policy
All BA 324 assignments are due before the beginning of class (unless otherwise posted). Assignments submitted later than
fifteen minutes after the deadline will be assessed a 20-percent deduction. Late assignments will only be accepted until the
beginning of the next class meeting. In other words, if an assignment is due by class Tuesday, you have until class begins
Thursday to submit with a 20% deduction from your total score.
File Naming Conventions and Following Instructions
Name all your submissions using the following format: PLEASE FOLLOW the instructions given!
BA324.InsertSection#_AssignmentName_YourLastName (OrTeamName)
If you improperly name your file, one warning will be given before penalty points are assessed. Likewise, if you fail to follow
submission instructions for an assignment (e.g., Canvas, TurnItIn, hard copy, etc.), your grade may be reduced.
BA324 Syllabus EHS Spring 2024 Page 11

Grade Questions
You are welcome to raise questions about potential data entry or calculation errors with me. If you do not understand the
reason that you received a specific grade on any assignment, carefully review all the feedback given. If you would like to
discuss your grade further, wait 24 hours after receiving your grade, but no more than one week, and schedule an
appointment to discuss grading questions. A tone of inquiry (e.g., “help me understand….”) is the most successful approach.
While I am happy to listen to your viewpoint or perception of an assignment or exam question, do not expect this to change
your grade since a major course objective is for you to learn how to understand and respond to other's viewpoints.
Remember that you are a student, learning new skills, and therefore, should not expect to be excellent.
Should the course teaching assistant initially evaluate the assignment, your first inquiry is with the teaching assistant.
Re-grading Policy
If you believe that your graded work received too little credit, you may submit it for a re-grade under the following
specific restrictions:
1. All requests must be submitted with a clear, written statement explaining why you believe the grade was incorrect.
2. All requests must be submitted within one (1) calendar week of when the graded work was returned.
3. The entire work will be regraded; if the initial grade was incorrect, points may be deducted. Thus, consider the
risk of regrading.
Final Grades
The final grade assigned in the course is an informed and final evaluation and is not open for discussion or negotiation. Any
lobbying efforts (e.g., asking for a higher grade because you want one, need one, my poor GPA, it should be rounded up, etc.)
will be perceived as grade grubbing. Lobbying does not demonstrate an audience-centered approach to management and will
not be successful. Except for what is listed in the syllabus, no additional assignments or extra credit are offered. To make
your desired grade in this course, you must produce consistent work that is of excellent quality to earn the points tied to the
grade-level standards indicated above. Please note that grades reflect your outputs and outcomes, not effort or improvement.
Grades in BA 324 are based on a student’s work in three key content areas: writing, speaking, and exams. These content areas
reflect the mission of the course, the course objectives, and the core communication skills that students are expected to learn.
Each of these content areas represents a fixed percentage of the course’s content. In two of these areas, there is a minimum
number of specific assignments required for all sections of the course. Students should review the required assignments for
their particular BA 324 section.
ATTENDANCE
Be advised that attendance policies may vary across professors in BA324. Attendance in this section is taken every class
period. You are responsible for tracking your attendance through Canvas and notifying me within one week of any
potential errors.
Class Absences
Since BA 324 teaches both conceptual knowledge and skills, daily attendance and active participation in the class are
required. Students should view class attendance as they would work attendance and communicate to their peers and
instructor in an appropriate manner. Students with personal or family emergencies should register their situation
with UT’s Student Emergency Services (SES) by logging onto http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/emergency/ or calling
512-471-5017. Requests for assignment extensions, modifications, or emergency leaves must be approved by SES.
I strictly adhere to the McCombs attendance, assignment submission, and late work policies described. If you are
experiencing a problem that may cause multiple absences and/or missed deadlines, please register your case with UT’s
Student Emergency Services (SES) by calling (512) 471-5017. In addition, contact me ASAP so we can discuss the best
course of action. Even if it feels challenging to communicate with me about these situations, I can only help you if I know
what’s going on and the sooner you tell me, the more options we have.
Be strategic with your absences; don’t use them in the beginning of the semester! You’ll likely get sick,
have priorities in other classes and organizations, or just need a personal day at some point over the
next three months.
You are granted one week of ‘vacation’ to use as you see fit. This means you have 2 days off from this course. If your
absences exceed two days, your final grade is reduced by ten points per absence (10 points off the total 1000 points).
BA324 Syllabus EHS Spring 2024 Page 12

This means you can quickly drop from an ‘B’ to a ‘C’. Instructors reserve the right to fail students whose absences exceed five
classes. Please register with Student Emergency Services if you must miss class for an approved emergency.
If this class converts to an online only format, attendance will still be taken on Zoom. It is important that you have your
camera on all the time and in attendance the full class time. Using just a Zoom photo is not accepted and you may be
counted absent. You cannot leave class early unless pre-arranged and you are expected to be on time to class, whether
online or in person. All students must be present unless an absence is excused through student emergency services.
Excused Absences
The only absences that will be considered excused are for religious holidays or extenuating circumstances registered
with SES due to an emergency. If you plan to miss class due to observance of a religious holiday, please let me know at
least two weeks in advance. You will not be penalized for this absence, although you will still be responsible for any work
you may miss on that day, if applicable. Check with me for details or arrangements.
Late Arrivals
If you arrive 5 minutes after the class has begun, you are considered late. After two late arrivals, you will receive a ten-
point deduction from your overall 1000 points (10-points equals one-point deduction per late arrival from your final grade…a
90 goes to an 89). For example, if you are late four times, and you have a 91-final grade (910) you will have two points
deducted from your final grade with a new final grade of 89 (your A- will now be a B+). If this class converts to an online only
format, the late arrival policy only applies to mandatory online meetings. Bottom line: be on time.
Communicating Absences to Professor and Team
Regardless of the reason for your absence(s), and especially in the case of group work, notify those impacted by your
absence. You are responsible for what you missed and must provide your team with the necessary information to
compensate for your absence. If you have to be absent, use your resources wisely. Ask your team and other classmates to
get information and notes on any information you missed.
Notification Regarding BBA Recruiting Conflicts (from the BBA Career Recruitment Office)
Conflicts occasionally arise between classes and the search for employment. We understand how important the job search
process is to you, and McCombs provides many resources in support of career exploration and search. However, UT is first
and foremost an educational institution and your BBA degree will be the credential that certifies your education. As such,
education will take precedent whenever such a conflict arises.
All companies that recruit at McCombs are informed of this fact. Should a conflict arise, we recommend the following steps:
1. Check the syllabus to see if an exception is provided that would allow you to satisfy class obligations while still
attending the job event (e.g., paper instead of quiz, allowed quiz drops, etc.).
2. Note that a job-related conflict, whether a current job or a potential one, is usually not an acceptable reason for
missing an exam or taking a make-up and may not be acceptable in other circumstances either. If any doubt exists,
check with your professor.
3. If no exception is provided, inform the company that an academic conflict exists and request an accommodation.
4. If no accommodation is provided by the company, and you have done everything within your power to resolve the
situation, contact BBA Career Services and request their assistance in resolving the situation.
Note that while we do have influence with the companies that recruit at McCombs, not all conflicts can be resolved, and we
have little or no influence with companies that do not recruit through the Recruit McCombs system.
Finally, be aware that it is not unreasonable for an employer to expect you to go to some lengths to show your interest in
them. In a recent example, several students completed an exam at 9 pm and were expected to attend an on-site interview in
Houston the next morning at 8 am. A 5:30 am flight from Austin was available and the students were expected to be on it.
This is reasonable, and such sacrifices are expected in the current job market.
Religious Holy Days
By UT Austin policy, you must notify me of your pending absence at least fourteen days prior to the date of observance
of a religious holy day. If you must miss a class, an examination, a work assignment, or a project in order to observe a
religious holy day, you will be given an opportunity to complete the missed work within a reasonable time after the absence.

TITLE IX reporting
Title IX is a federal law that protects against sex and gender-based discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual assault,
sexual misconduct, dating/domestic violence and stalking at federally funded educational institutions. UT Austin is
committed to fostering a learning and working environment free from discrimination in all its forms.
BA324 Syllabus EHS Spring 2024 Page 15

When sexual misconduct occurs in our community, the university can:
1. Intervene to prevent harmful behavior from continuing or escalating.
2. Provide support and remedies to students and employees who have experienced harm or have become involved in
a Title IX investigation.
3. Investigate and discipline violations of the university’s relevant policies.
Beginning January 1, 2020, Texas Senate Bill 212 requires all employees of Texas universities, including faculty, report
any information to the Title IX Office regarding sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating violence and stalking that is
disclosed to them. Texas law requires that all employees who witness or receive any information of this type (including,
but not limited to, writing assignments, class discussions, or one-on-one conversations) must be reported. I am a
Responsible Employee and must report any Title IX related incidents that are disclosed in writing, discussion,
or one-on-one. Before talking with me, or with any faculty or staff member about a Title IX related incident, be sure to ask
whether they are a responsible employee. If you would like to speak with someone who can provide support or remedies
without making an official report to the university, please email advocate@austin.utexas.edu. For more information about
reporting options and resources, visit http://www.titleix.utexas.edu/, contact the Title IX Office via email at
titleix@austin.utexas.edu, or call 512-471-0419.
Although graduate teaching and research assistants are not subject to Texas Senate Bill 212, they are still mandatory
reporters under Federal Title IX laws and are required to report a wide range of behaviors we refer to as sexual
misconduct, including the types of sexual misconduct covered under Texas Senate Bill 212. The Title IX office has
developed supportive ways to respond to a survivor and compiled campus resources to support survivors.
Emergency evacuation procedures
The following recommendations regarding emergency evacuation from the Office of Campus Safety and Security, 512-471-
5767, http://www.utexas.edu/safety/
UNIVERSITY HEALTH INFORMATION
• Protect Texas Together: Protect Texas Together will continue to serve as the hub for all university COVID-19
information.
• Accessible Testing: Throughout the fall, the university will continue to make testing accessible by providing rapid
antigen self-test kits at distribution sites throughout campus. Staff, faculty and students can receive up to four at a
time. You are encouraged to keep a supply of self-test kits in your residence so that you have them available when you
need them. Look for the Healthyhorns QR code sticker on the self-test kits provided by the university that links to
important information related to testing.
• Off-Campus Testing: Staff and faculty members who are symptomatic can test at a local pharmacy or can contact
their primary care provider. Self-testing is accurate and encouraged. As a reminder, self-test kits are also available for
free through the federal government, and coverage is available under the UT SELECT prescription drug program for
FDA-approved COVID-19 self-test kits at no cost to members.
• Possible Exposure: The exposure action chart offers guidance on what to do if you have been exposed to someone
who has COVID-19 or if you test positive. If you experience symptoms, stay home and isolate and follow the
instructions in the chart for symptomatic people.
• Leave/Return to Work: If you test positive or have symptoms, consult the HealthPoint Occupational Health
Program for guidance on leave of absence and returning to work.
