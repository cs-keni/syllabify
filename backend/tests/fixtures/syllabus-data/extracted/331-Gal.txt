Prerequisites: The following coursework with a grade of at least C- in each
course: CS 311 or 311H, 314 or 314H, 429 or 429H; M 408C or 408N; SSC
321 or M 362K; and a pre-req or co-req of M 340L or SSC 329C.
Course description: This course provides a general, undergraduate level
introduction to algorithms and complexity. The course will cover the most
important algorithmic techniques, and methods to analyze the performance
of algorithms. The following major topics will be covered: graph algorithms,
greedyalgorithms, divide-and-conquer, dynamicprogramming, networkflow,
NP-completeness, undecidability, approximation algorithms, randomized al-
gorithms.
Textbook: “Algorithm Design”, by Jon Kleinberg and Eva Tardos.
Homework: There will be regular homework. The assignments will be
paper/pencil exercises.
Exams: There will be three written tests during the course on September
23, October 28 and December 4 in class. No make-up exams will be
given.
Grading: Homework: 25%, Test 1: 25%, Test 2: 25%, Test 3: 25%.
