Section 3. Tools & Materials
Textbook: We will be using Fundamentals of Corporate Finance, 12th edition, by Ross,
Westerfield & Jordan, published by McGraw-Hill Education. The loose-leaf
version of the textbook, combined with the required Connect Access Code, is
ISBN 9781260700831. It is available at the Co-op. YOU MUST BUY THE VERSION
BUNDLED WITH CONNECT (Online homework)
Connect: Connect will be our homework tool. To get started, go to the FIN 357 page on
Canvas and click on the link called “McGraw-Hill Connect.” Detailed instructions
are posted in Canvas. For assistance, click on “Help” in the upper-right hand
corner of the screen, or call (800) 331-5094.

iClicker: We will be using the iClicker Classic remote student response system during class
each day. You can use new or used iClicker, iClicker+ or iClicker2, all of which are
available at the Co-op and online. You must register your clicker on Canvas and
start bringing it to class by the 2nd day of class. To register your clicker on
Canvas, go to the FIN 357 Canvas page, select “i>Clicker” from the left-hand
menu bar, and click on “i>clicker Registration.” Enter your clicker number and
click “Register.”
If you get a new clicker any time after the 2nd class day, register it on Canvas and
email me your name, eid, unique number, and clicker number. You will receive
points for all of the “clicks” sent by your new clicker, effective as of the date that
your clicker is registered and your email to me has been sent.
Calculator: You will need a calculator that can perform financial functions (e.g. N, I, PV, PMT
and FV). The HP 10B II financial calculator is recommended. You will not be
allowed to use a cell phone or online financial calculator during an exam, nor will
you be allowed to share your calculator with another student during an exam.
Email: The General Information Catalog states: "Electronic mail (e-mail), like postal
mail, is a mechanism for official University communication to students. The
University will exercise the right to send e-mail communications to all students,
and the University will expect that e-mail communications will be received and
read in a timely manner." You can verify and/or update your email address here:
https://utdirect.utexas.edu/apps/utd/all_my_addresses/
Periodicals: It is highly recommended that you begin (or continue) the lifelong process of
remaining abreast of business impacts of current events. Suggested reading
includes The Wall Street Journal and The Financial Times (both are daily
newspapers), and The Economist, Business Week, and Fortune magazines.
Instructions for subscribing at reduced student prices will be posted on Canvas.
Section 4. Prerequisites
To remain enrolled in FIN 357, you must have successfully completed STA 309 or 309H, and
have completed or registered for ACC 312 or 312H, and B A 324 or 324H. Students lacking these
prerequisite will be dropped. Visit the BBA Program Office, CBA 2.400, for assistance.
Section 5. Tutoring
This course is supported by a Peer-Led Undergraduate Studying (PLUS) program, coordinated by
the Sanger Learning Center. PLUS study groups provide weekly opportunities to collaboratively
practice skills and apply knowledge you need for success in this course. Attending study groups
regularly is a great way to ensure that you are keeping up with the material so you don’t fall
behind. Feel free to attend any study group at any time during the semester; details on times
and locations will be posted on Canvas and announced in class. More information about PLUS
can be found at https://www.utexas.edu/ugs/slc/support/plus.

Section 6. Grading
Your grade in this course will be determined by your performance on the following:
• Exams: 3 exams @ 25% each 75%
• Connect Homework: The lowest 2 percentage scores will be dropped 5%
• Daily iClicker Quizzes: The lowest 5 percentage scores will be dropped 5%
• Quizzes: The lowest percentage score will be dropped 10%
• Valuation Exercise: Excel-based case to be completed during class 5%
Course Total 100%
The McCombs grading guidelines recommend a GPA range from 3.0 to 3.2 for undergraduate
business core courses. Historically, the cut-off for each letter grade was as shown below.
A 93-100% B- 80-82% D+ 67-69%
A- 90-92% C+ 77-79% D 63-66%
B+ 87-89% C 73-76% D- 60-62%
B 83-86% C- 70-72% F 0-59%
The actual cut-off will depend on overall class performance. In other words, past performance
is not a guarantee of future results. The University-approved +/- grading system will be
employed. Make-up or extra work to improve your grade is not possible. Your final letter grade
will be determined by the criteria set forth above.
Section 7. Exams
All students enrolled in FIN 357 will take common exams on the dates noted in the course
schedule. Exams will begin at 6:30 pm and end at 8:30 pm. Exam locations will be posted on
Canvas and announced during class. The Finance department has confirmed that our exams do
not conflict with any other exams on the Dean’s master list of undergraduate evening exams.
There will be three exams. All material covered in the course, including readings from the text,
readings from supplementary materials, class discussions, end-of-chapter problems called
“Connect to Finance,” “Chapter Review and Self-Test Problems,“ “Concept Review and Critical
Thinking Questions,” and end-of-chapter “Questions and Problems” are subject to examination.
Each exam will be non-comprehensive; that is, each will cover only the material related to that
section. However, the material will build on itself as we proceed through the semester.
After they have been graded, exams can be reviewed in my office, during my office hours.
Make-up exams are offered for only the following reasons:
• A conflict with another UT course,
• Participation in a University-sponsored event,
• A conflict with a University-recognized religious holy day,
• A medical event (such as illness or injury) documented by Student Emergency Services.

If you have any circumstance other than a medical emergency that will necessitate taking a
make-up exam this semester, you must request permission and provide documentation no later
than Monday, February 4th. Make-up exams will occur on the following dates:
• Make-up Exam 1: Friday, February 22nd
• Make-up Exam 2: Friday, April 5th
• Make-up Exam 3: Friday, May 10th
Section 8. Homework and Additional Online Preparation
Homework: At the end of each chapter of your text, there are a plethora of practice
problems. Several of the computational “Questions and Problems” have been
assigned as required homework in Connect. The assignments are graded, but you
can use the “Check My Work” function before you submit. Your 2 lowest
assignment grades will be dropped.
Homework is due in Connect by 11:59 pm (one minute before midnight) on the
due date. Due dates are provided in the Course Schedule at the end of this
syllabus, as well as in Connect. Homework is usually due on a Sunday, with the
exception of CH 24, which is due on a Tuesday. After their due dates, the
homework problems will become available to re-work for additional practice.
LearnSmart: Connect also provides access to an adaptive learning tool called LearnSmart. This
tool is an excellent way to approach your first reading of each chapter. More
information about LearnSmart will be provided during class. Your LearnSmart
results will not be graded.
Prep Courses: If you are concerned about your Excel skills, or your memories of Accounting or
Statistics are hazy, take advantage of the preparatory courses in Connect.
Section 9. iClicker Quizzes
There will be a pop quiz each day during class. You will submit your answers using your iClicker.
You will earn 2 points for each correct answer you submit, or 1 point for each incorrect answer.
If you do not submit an answer, you will earn 0 points. Your 5 lowest grades will be dropped.
You are not allowed to share a clicker with, or borrow a clicker from anyone currently enrolled
in any section of FIN 357 that I teach. Allowing another student in this course to use your
clicker, or using the clicker of another student in this course, or simply having more than one
clicker in your possession is a violation of the University’s rules regarding academic integrity. A
minimum penalty of a full course grade deduction (e.g. from B- to C-) will be assessed against
any student who violates these rules. Student Judicial Services may assess additional penalties,
up to and including expulsion from the University.
Section 10. Quizzes
Three multiple choice quizzes will be given on the dates listed on the schedule. Each will cover
multiple chapters and be given during the first 25 minutes of class. There are no make-ups, but

the lowest of the 3 quiz grades will be dropped. Extra credit may be awarded on random days
for students displaying a name tent for the entire class period.
Section 11. Valuation Exercise
Near the end of the semester, you will be provided with the opportunity to demonstrate your
understanding of many FIN 357 concepts via an integrative valuation exercise. This exercise
must be completed during class, using Excel. You must have a computer with you during class to
complete the exercise. If necessary, you can rent a computer from the Media Services desk on
the 3rd floor of McCombs. For practice using your Excel skills, refer to the prep course on
Connect and/or Lynda.com. If you are absent on the day of the in-class valuation exercise and
your absence is not substantiated by Student Emergency Services, you may, at my convenience,
be given a new case to complete in my office. The highest possible score for a make-up case is
50%. Details will be announced during class.
Section 12. Religious Holy Days
Many religious and cultural holidays take place during the spring semester. Be sure to submit
your homework early to avoid any conflicts. By UT Austin policy, you must notify me of your
pending absence at least fourteen days prior to the date of observance of a religious holy day. If
you must miss a class, an examination, a work assignment, or a project in order to observe a
religious holy day, and you have provided proper advance notice, you will be given an
opportunity to complete the missed work within a reasonable time before or after the absence.
Section 13. Students with Disabilities
Students with disabilities may request appropriate academic accommodations from the
Division of Diversity and Community Engagement, Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD),
512-471-6259, http://diversity.utexas.edu/disability/. If you are eligible for academic
accommodations you must present your SSD letter during my office hours, at least two weeks
before you wish to employ the accommodation. Deadlines to request SSD accommodations are
below:
• Exam 1: Monday, February 4th
• Exam 2: Monday, March 11th
• Exam 3: Wednesday, April 24th
Section 14. Academic Integrity
The McCombs School of Business has no tolerance for acts of scholastic dishonesty. The
responsibilities of both students and faculty with regard to scholastic dishonesty are described
in detail in the Policy Statement on Scholastic Dishonesty for the McCombs School of Business.
By teaching this course, I have agreed to observe the faculty responsibilities described in that
document. By enrolling in this class, you have agreed to observe the student responsibilities

described in that document. If the application of that Policy Statement to this class and its
assignments is unclear in any way, it is your responsibility to ask me for clarification. Students
who violate University rules on scholastic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary penalties,
including the possibility of failure in the course and/or dismissal from the University. Since
dishonesty harms the individual, all students, and the integrity of the University, policies on
scholastic dishonesty will be strictly enforced. Refer to the Student Judicial Services website or
the General Information Catalog to access the official University policies and procedures on
scholastic dishonesty as well as further elaboration on what constitutes scholastic dishonesty.
Section 15. Campus Safety
“Please note the following information from the Office of Campus Safety and Security, 512-471-
5767, http://www.utexas.edu/safety:
• If an alarm is activated, we are required to exit the building. Please follow my instructions.
• Familiarize yourself with all exit doors. Remember that the nearest exit door may not be the
one you used when entering the building.
