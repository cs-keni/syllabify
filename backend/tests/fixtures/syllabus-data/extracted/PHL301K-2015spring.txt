Description
Western philosophy owes its birth to the ancient Greeks. In their care many of
the fundamental questions in ethics, epistemology, metaphysics, and the
philosophy of mind were raised for the first time and developed in striking and
sophisticated ways. We will try to determine which questions they asked, what
their answers were, and whether we should accept their answers as correct even
now. Readings will be drawn primarily from the works of Plato, but will also
include material from some important Pre-Platonic thinkers.

Quizzes [15%]
• At the beginning (or in the middle) of exactly 15 of our 30 lecture meetings,
there will be a short quiz on the readings assigned for that meeting. These
quizzes are designed to be relatively easy for anyone who has completed the
relevant readings. Each quiz will be worth 1% of your final grade.
Participation [10%]
• The lecture meetings of this course are designed to be interactive. You will
have many opportunities at each meeting to ask questions, raise objections,
defend positions, and so on. Part of your participation grade will be based on
the quantity and quality of your contributions to this component of the lecture
meetings.
• The purpose of the Friday discussion sections is to give you an opportunity to
engage with the course material, and with each other, in a more active and
collaborative manner than is possible during the lecture meetings. Another part
of your participation grade will be based on the quantity and quality of your
contributions to the discussion meetings.
• Every now and then Matt will post questions in the “Discussions” section of the
301K CANVAS website. You are encouraged, but not required, to offer an
answer, respond to someone else’s answer, ask a further question, and so on.
You are also encouraged, but not required, to post your own questions or to
respond to questions posted by other students. Any contribution you make to
the “Discussions” section of the site will count as extra credit toward your
participation grade.
