Course Objectives
This course covers business valuation and equity valuation. The goal of the course is to provide students
with a deep understanding of the core corporate finance concepts, and with practical tools and methods
to value a broad range of assets. While the course is designed first and foremost to be very practical, the
tools and methods covered in this course are presented in the framework of generally accepted financial
theory.
The course starts with a broad overview and discussion of valuation techniques. There are a number of
different ways to try and determine the value of an asset, and it is almost always good practice to use
more than one valuation method. Following the overview of valuation techniques, we start with methods
for calculating the discount rate used in cash flow valuation methods. Our discount rate discussion
involves determining the firm’s cost of capital – both debt and equity capital – and the effect of leverage
(debt) on the firm’s cost of equity and the firm’s overall cost of capital. Following our discount rate
discussion we cover valuation effects of a firm’s capital structure.
After our discount rate and capital structure classes we start coverage of cash flow valuation techniques
used to value businesses and equity. We start with the discounted cash flow method (DCF), which is the
most widely used cash flow valuation method. DCF valuation models are well-suited for sensitivity
analysis, and we will cover methods for modeling the effects of varying material inputs of the DCF
model. Cash flow valuation methods include many uncertain inputs, and sensitivity analysis help reveal
the effects of varying the major inputs of the valuation. I will go through a detailed DCF example in
class, and students will perform a valuation and sensitivity analysis on a company of their choosing as
one of the major assignments of the course. Following the DCF work, we will cover the use of relative
valuation multiples (e.g., EV/EBITDA, P/E) and work through an HBS case on the use of valuation
multiples in determining firm and equity value. We conclude the course with a discussion of other
valuation techniques, control premiums and liquidity discounts, and a look at valuation in both LBO and
M&A contexts.
Prerequisites: Core MBA classes on accounting, statistics, and finance are a prerequisite. Working

knowledge of EXCEL is also important. Students who hope to never see a financial statement again
should not take this course. Students should expect the workload for this course to be demanding.
Students who took this course in the past have indicated that the workload is heavy compared to other
courses.
Materials
Required HBS Case material
• The Boston Beer Company, Inc. – HBS Case #196138
Optional Textbooks
The material taught in class is a collection of concepts and examples drawn from several textbooks,
research papers, and newspapers. Thus I do not require any textbook. For those students who want to
have a reference book, the two textbooks below are the closest in spirit to what I teach in class:
• Valuation: The Art & Science of Corporate Investment Decisions, by Sheridan Titman and
John Martin, Prentice Hall, 2010 3rd Edition, ISBN-10: 0133479528
• Corporate Finance, Jonathan Berk and Peter DeMarzo, 4th Edition, 2016, Prentice Hall, ISBN-
10: 013408327X
The Wall Street Journal, Financial Times, the New York Times business section, the Economist, or
Business Week are all recommended. We will cover the conceptual material to help you think through
financial decisions. However, we will discuss current financial news during the first 10 minutes of each
class.
Course Requirements and Grading
Your grade in the course will be determined as follows:
Assignment Points
In-Class Contribution 10
HW#1 (FCF & Discount Rate) Individual -
HW #2 (DCF Valuation) Individual 30
Valuation Case (Boston Beer) Group 20
Final Exam Individual 40
100
Make-up and extra-credit assignments are generally not possible. Your grade will be determined solely
by the components listed above. The homework assignments are individual. The case is a group
assignments. The average turn-around time for returning the graded HWs and cases back to students is
two weeks. The students have two weeks after the assignments are returned to ask questions about the
grading and ask for a re-grade.
During the off-class weeks, I will send current articles and materials that I find on newspapers and
websites that are pertinent to the topics discussed in class. Please read these articles, discuss them with
your group, and be ready to talk about it in class. These article assignments count as asynchronous
content.

The final examination will be administered on March 9th . The final exam is cumulative and covers all
material mentioned in the course. You are allowed one letter-sized sheet of paper, where you can write,
front and back, any formula or information you might need. A regular non-programmable calculator is
also allowed. No other material is allowed. The best way to prepare for the final exam is by going through
examples from the lecture notes and the textbook after each lecture and by working through problem sets
and the sample final exam. Please note the scheduling of the exam. You are responsible for ensuring that
you are available and on campus to take the exam. I will not FAX exams to remote locations. I will not
permit anyone to take the exams at another time unless you are gravely ill, face a significant emergency
or have an exam conflict. If your travel plans conflict with the date of an exam, you should change your
travel plans now, or drop the course. Please advise potential employers that you cannot schedule
interviews that conflict with your exam schedule.
A forced curve will be used for grading purposes. The target grade distribution follows the Texas MBA
program recommended distribution, with approximately:
A (4.00) 25%
A- (3.67) 20%
B+ (3.33) 15%
B (3.00) 35%
B- (2.67) or below 5%
C‘s, D’s and F’s will be awarded where deserved. Natural breaks in the distribution will be used to
determine the final grade distribution. No student is allowed to take the course on a pass/fail basis.
Discussion Board
I invite students to post these questions on the discussion board of the forum. My TAs and I will also join
the forum as active participants and moderators. This discussion forum is the primary mode of
communication for addressing finance topics outside the classroom. My TAs and I will only answer
emails regarding questions or concerns about grades, attendance and other individual matters.
McCombs Classroom Professionalism Policy
The highest professional standards are expected of all members of the McCombs community. The
collective class reputation and the value of the Texas MBA experience hinges on this. Faculty are
expected to be professional and prepared to deliver value for each and every class session. Students are
expected to be professional in all respects. I expect the students to agree on the following set of common
classroom policies:
• The use of electronic devices is not allowed at any time unless explicitly directed at the discretion
of the professor. While technology and analytics will be discussed and used extensively during the
course, I believe that screens can also be a great source of distraction. When students are surfing the
web, responding to e-mails, instant messaging each other, and otherwise not devoting their full
attention to the topic at hand, they are doing themselves and their peers a major disservice. Those
around them face additional distraction. Fellow students cannot benefit from the insights of the
students who are not engaged.

Cesare Fracassi FIN 286 – Valuation – Spring 2019 page 4
• Class Attendance is required. If you miss three or more classes (i.e. more than 20% of the total
number of lectures) for non-religious or health related issues, you will fail the class, and you will be
asked to retake the course at a time that is more convenient for you. The education experience for
everyone suffers if participation or attendance for the class becomes a problem. If you must miss a
class, an examination, a work assignment, or a project, in order to observe religious holidays, you
will be given an opportunity to complete the missed work within a reasonable timeframe after the
absence.
• Students are required to arrive on time. If a student knows of any scheduling conflict, he/she will
notify the class in advance by email. n time arrival ensures that classes are able to start and finish at
the scheduled time. On time arrival shows respect for both fellow students and faculty and it enhances
learning by reducing avoidable distractions.
• Students are required to display their name cards. This permits fellow students and faculty to
learn names, enhancing opportunities for community building and evaluation of in-class
contributions.
• Turning in your assignment up to a week late for other than health, significant personal, or
religious reasons will reduce your grade by 30%. Assignments cannot be turned in more than a
week late. Individual extension of assignment deadlines could negatively alter the level-playing field
within the classroom.
Remember, you are competing for the best faculty McCombs has to offer. Your professionalism and
activity in class contributes to your success in attracting the best faculty to this program.
Students with Disabilities
Upon request, the University of Texas at Austin provides appropriate academic accommodations for
qualified students with disabilities. Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD) is housed in the Office
of the Dean of Students, located on the fourth floor of the Student Services Building. Information on how
to register, downloadable forms, including guidelines for documentation, accommodation request letters,
and releases of information are available online at http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/ssd/index.php. Please
do not hesitate to contact SSD at (512) 471-6259, VP: (512) 232-2937 or via e-mail if you have any
questions.
Academic Dishonesty
I have no tolerance for acts of academic dishonesty. Such acts damage the reputation of the school and
the degree and demean the honest efforts of the majority of students. The minimum penalty for an act of
academic dishonesty will be a zero for that assignment or exam.
The responsibilities for both students and faculty with regard to the Honor System can be found at
http://www.engr.utexas.edu/undergraduate/forms/462-university-of-texas-honor-code. As the instructor
for this course, I agree to observe all the faculty responsibilities described therein. As a Texas student,
you agree to observe all of the student responsibilities of the Honor Code. If the application of the Honor
System to this class and its assignments is unclear in any way, it is your responsibility to ask me for
clarification.
As specific guidance for this course, you should consider the writing of all examinations to be an
individual effort. Group preparation for examinations is acceptable and encouraged. Individual
assignments are to be turned in individually but I encourage you to work together in answering the
questions. You should, however, develop your own answer and not cut and paste the work of others.

A fundamental principle for any educational institution, academic integrity is highly valued and seriously
regarded at The University of Texas at Austin, as emphasized in the standards of conduct. More
specifically, you and other students are expected to "maintain absolute integrity and a high standard of
individual honor in scholastic work" undertaken at the University (Sec. 11-801, Institutional Rules on
Student Services and Activities). This is a very basic expectation that is further reinforced by the
University's Honor Code. If in doubt, please ask me, or consult the honor code.
