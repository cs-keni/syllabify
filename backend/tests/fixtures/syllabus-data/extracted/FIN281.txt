This syllabus should be your first stop if you have questions about the course and its organization.
The contents list below will help you navigate to the relevant section.
Personal Finance is an asynchronous online course, delivered via Canvas. As such it is asynchronous,
with no scheduled class meeting time. Office hours will also be offered online via zoom.
Prerequisites
No prerequisites. Business Majors can take the course (need to be manually cleared by an academic
advisor in Lundquist) and please note that it doesn’t count toward any requirement for the business
major or minor. This class is an elective and does not count toward general education requirements.
Course Description
Overview of lifetime personal finance strategies. Topics include financial goals and building net
worth, major purchasing decisions, credit use, tax planning, retirement and estate planning.
Course Overview
I am so glad that you chose to join us as we navigate our way through a multitude of personal
finance topics on our way to achieving financial literacy and success. You will learn how personal
finance affects almost every aspect of our lives, and gain the information and tools necessary to
understand the financial implications of ordinary, everyday decisions. You will immediately be able to
Page 1 of 12

apply your new-found skills, and you will carry those skills with you at every stage of your journey
through life. The stakes are high! Master the material in this course and not only will you earn a
good grade, but you will be well prepared to make sound financial decisions, and to meet whatever
financial challenges the future might bring.
I know that personal finance can seem daunting. We shall be thinking about money management,
mortgages, credit reports, auto loans, interest rates, taxes and estate planning and more. There will
be math involved! But have no fear. Personal finance need not be difficult. You will learn to ignore
irrelevant information, process relevant information, and critically reason your way to a better
financial future. And we will even have some fun on the way!
Congratulations, you are taking the first steps on the path towards lifetime financial success.
What You Should Know About Online Classes
Online classes are offered for students who are unable to attend regular classes (because of job or
other commitments, distance from Eugene, etc.). Also, some students take online classes because
they prefer the flexibility that an online class adds to their schedule. The material in this online
version of this class is the same as that in the lecture version and the assessments are similar in
format and difficulty. However, online classes require more discipline on your part than face-to-face
classes given the necessity of mastering the material primarily from the textbook, instructor videos
and related sources (both offline and online) and the lack of set class time.
To succeed in an online class, you must be extremely motivated and well organized.
I highly recommended that you schedule regular times through the week that you devote to this
class.
Required Materials and Tech
Focus on Personal Finance, Kapoor, Dlabay, Hughes, Hart, 7th Ed., McGraw Hill. I recommend the
180 day rental for about $52. You do not need a Connect code, but it does come with the rental.
You must have the text.
High speed internet access is required. If you are not near campus it is your responsibility to ensure
you have consistent access to complete requirements. If you need help figuring out options let me
know.
Calculator: You need a calculator. It does not need to be a financial calculator. It does need to be
able to take a square root, find a natural log (have the LN or ln button), and raise to a power
(exponent) besides two. You should be able to get a calculator for under $20. One example would
be the Texas Instruments TI-30XIIS which is about $16. If you already have a graphing or financial
calculator that is fine as well. Also, you can potentially use the expanded calculator on your phone
or computer this term. There is some math in this class and basic math skills are expected.

EXCEL: You may find Excel to be a useful tool and can access it in computer labs on campus. You
do not need to have it on your own laptop.
Course Outcome(s)
When you have competed this course, you will have developed the skills and knowledge to be able
to make smart financial decisions at all stages of your life.
Learning Objectives
After completing this course, you will be able to:
1. Plan your finances using time value of money tools
2. Manage your money with goals, budgets, and personal financial statements
3. Utilize consumer credit and purchasing fundamentals to make wise spending decisions
4. Compare housing options based on the financial implications
5. Make investing decisions to plan for a comfortable retirement (Tip: start ASAP!)
6. Describe the different types of insurance and how to use insurance to manage risk
7. Develop an estate plan (it's never too early)
Expectations of Students
Per university guidelines, a 4-credit course should list 120 hours of activities in which students are
engaged over the course of the term. Realize that you should therefore expect to spend an
average of 12 hours per week on this class during the 10-week term.
You will need to be highly engaged to succeed in this class. There are many written assignments
with due dates throughout the term, weekly quizzes, and discussions that require timely responses.
Organization and timeliness are keys to success.
How Your Grade Will Be Determined
Quizzes: 16%
In each week of the 10-week term you will complete a graded quiz on canvas. The quizzes are not
timed and can be accessed multiple times throughout the week. I drop your lowest two quizzes and
the remaining 8 are worth 16% of your grade. Be aware that the quizzes simply disappear at
exactly 11:59 pm Pacific so you cannot submit something late. The two dropped quizzes are built-in
flexibility to allow for technology issues, personal emergencies, illness, etc. In order to be fair to all
students, please do not ask for special consideration, it will not be granted.
Page 3 of 12

Discussions: 35%
There are 5 required discussion board responses throughout the term. They are worth 35% (7%
each) of your grade and details can be found on canvas. Note each discussion consists of a post and
a reply to a teammate’s post.
Personal Financial Plan: 36%
The personal financial plan will have three deliverables spread throughout the term. Each deliverable
requires you to start early to complete the requirements, it can’t be done in one day. Each
deliverable is worth 12% of your grade for a total of 36%.
Final Reflection and Action Plan: 13%
The final reflection and action plan is due finals week worth 13% of your term grade. You may think
of it as a cumulative take home written final exam that will be submitted on canvas.
See late policies below. There is no curve, and there is no extra credit. If you cannot meet the
requirements for the class please withdraw.
Assessment % of grade
Discussion group (post/reply 5 times during 35%
term)
Individual personal financial plan (3 36%

8 of 10 Quizzes (lowest two dropped) 16%
Final Reflection and Action Plan 13%
Total 100%
Late Work Policy
It is important to stay on task in online courses and the deliverables are established to help you do
so. I highly recommend you utilize the canvas calendar, course calendar, or create your own to track
due dates.
These late policies hold in all cases and are reason-neutral per university guidelines.
Covid-19, flu, death in family, hospitalization, etc. all are treated the same under a
reason-neutral policy. Essentially, the reason for being late does not matter, these late
policies are followed.
Page 4 of 12

Quizzes
Quizzes will not be accepted late under any circumstances, including illness, family
emergency, technology issues, travel, sports, work, etc. Instead, I will drop your lowest two quizzes
for the term which allows for each individual student to have an “out” when they need it. My advice
is to plan to complete every quiz so when the unexpected happens you have a safety net. If you
email me asking for a late quiz to be accepted, I am unlikely to reply, as the answer is right here.
Discussion Posts
Discussion posts will not be accepted late under any circumstances and you will miss those
points if you miss the deadline. If you miss the due date to post, you can still respond to your
discussion group members to earn 2/10 points before that second deadline.
Individual Personal Financial Plan
Each deliverable will be accepted up to 48 hours late and will incur a letter grade penalty
approximately for each 24 hours. As soon it is late (10 minute grace period) and for each 24 hour
period thereafter, your grade is reduced by one full letter grade. So, if you submit 11 minutes up to
one day late, the highest you can earn is an 89%, add a minute and up to two days late highest is
79%, etc. After 48 hours you can submit up to two weeks late but will incur a 40 point penalty, the
highest you can earn is 60%. This accounts for the extra time one might have if they are unprepared
and claim to have an illness/emergency while also allowing those with an illness/emergency to still
pass the class.
Final Reflection and Action Plan
Will be accepted up to 48 hours late and will incur a letter grade penalty approximately for each 24
hours as above. After that you would need to request an incomplete in the course which is subject
to instructor approval and the maximum grade may be 60% as above. You must request the
incomplete by Monday of finals week and all university criteria for an incomplete must be met.
Grading Scale
Here is an outline of the letter grade criteria in this course:
Average Letter grade
98-100% A+
94-97% A
90-93% A-
87-89% B+
84-86% B
80-83% B-
Page 5 of 12

Average Letter grade
77-79% C+
74-76% C
70-73% C-
65-69% D
Below 65% F
I round up anything .50 and higher. There will not be a curve. You may also have the option of
taking the class pass/no pass, please see degree requirements. 70% and above is passing, 69%
and below is not passing.
Sharing out or receiving any information from the class assessments is a form of academic
misconduct per the university student conduct code. Please don’t do it and be prepared to get an F
in this course as well as other University sanctions (up to expulsion) if you do. If you share my quiz
questions or other course content to an internet site they can track you through your account and
you will get an F, even if the course has ended, I can always change your grade. You’ll also be
violating my copyright and I will pursue action against you. Don’t mean to sound harsh, just don’t
do it and you don’t have to worry about any of this.

Questions/Virtual Office Hours
Office hours will be held via Zoom for this online course as not every student is in Eugene. See the
start here module on canvas for dates, times, and link.
If you have general course questions (likely answered in the syllabus) or questions on the material,
please post them on the “Raise your hand” discussion board. You should feel free to add to, answer,
Page 7 of 12

or comment on others’ questions. This is a real opportunity for you to engage with the class, and
with each other. How much you choose to participate in this way is up to you, just like raising your
hand in the classroom. It is not graded but you could lose points if you do not abide by the rules of
engagement. See below. Please check the “Raise your hand” discussion board before you post,
because someone else might already have asked the same question. You can add to or answer
another person's question if you wish, and we will build up a set of questions and answers.
If you have a question that relates to your grade, or something else of a personal nature, please use
email to communicate with me. Please do not email me questions regarding course material, these
questions belong on the “Raise your hand” discussion board so that everyone can benefit from
them.
Your communication on the discussion boards should be professional, respectful, spellchecked, and
not use abbreviations. I reserve the right to drop your grade by half a letter grade if you do not
abide by this rule.
Please expect a response from me on either the discussion board or via email within 48 hours. I
check the site and my email frequently and may get back to you sooner, but if you expect 48 hours
you will not be disappointed.
You may also schedule an appointment with me to ask questions over Zoom. Email me at
djbauer@uoregon.edu and we can set up a phone call or video call. I am here to help, just ask and
we will make it work.

Incomplete Policy
UO Incomplete Policy
Plagiarism and Academic Misconduct
The University Student Conduct Code defines academic misconduct. Students are prohibited from
committing or attempting to commit any act that constitutes academic misconduct. By way of
example, students should not give or receive (or attempt to give or receive) unauthorized help on
assignments or examinations without express permission from the instructor. Students should
properly acknowledge and document all sources of information (e.g. quotations, paraphrases, ideas)
and use only the sources and resources authorized by the instructor. If there is any question about
whether an act constitutes academic misconduct, it is the students’ obligation to clarify the question
with the instructor before committing or attempting to commit the act. Additional information about
a common form of academic misconduct, plagiarism, is available at the UO Libraries Citation and
Plagiarism page.
Use of any AI or other software to produce responses or portray knowledge as your own without
citation is in violation of academic policies in this course and will result in an F similar to any other
plagiarism. If you use ChatGPT or similar on a written assignment, it is fine! Just cite it and include
the query you used.
Lundquist College of Business Code of Conduct
The Lundquist College of Business learning community is committed to a set of core values that
guide our interactions with one another. Our values are as important within our Lundquist College
community as within the business community. Our values help define both how we aspire to act and
what it means to be a business professional.
Page 9 of 12

• Integrity
Members of our community act with integrity and honesty. These qualities are essential in
providing a basis for trust and go to the core of what is expected from business
professionals.
• Respect
Our community conveys respect for the dignity of all people. Our relationships are based on
mutual respect. Differences of opinion are discussed openly and civilly. These discussions
focus on issues and are presented in a courteous manner. We are sensitive to the impacts of
both our words and actions on others.
• Openness
We encourage all members of our community to exchange ideas freely within the bounds of
reasonable behavior. We recognize that learning requires an open environment.
• Responsibility
We act publicly and accept responsibility for our actions. We understand that the community
will keep us accountable for our dealings. We deliver on the commitments and promises we
make to others.
• Teamwork
Our community is stronger when we work as a team. We foster attitudes encouraging
members of the community to give and receive constructive criticism, and develop creative
solutions to challenges.
Accessible Education
The University of Oregon is working to create inclusive learning environments. Please notify me if
there are aspects of the instruction or design of this course that result in disability-related barriers to
your participation. You are also encouraged to contact the Accessible Education Center in 164
Oregon Hall at 541-346-1155 or uoaec@uoregon.edu.
Mental Health and Wellness
Life at college can be very complicated. Students often feel overwhelmed or stressed, experience
anxiety or depression, struggle with relationships, or just need help navigating challenges in their
life. If you're facing such challenges, you don't need to handle them on your own--there's help and
support on campus.
As your instructor if I believe you may need additional support, I will express my concerns, the
reasons for them, and refer you to resources that might be helpful. It is not my intention to know
the details of what might be bothering you, but simply to let you know I care and that help is
available. Getting help is a courageous thing to do—for yourself and those you care about.
Page 10 of 12

University Health Services help students cope with difficult emotions and life stressors. If you need
general resources on coping with stress or want to talk with another student who has been in the
same place as you, visit the Duck Nest (located in the EMU on the ground floor) and get help from
one of the specially trained Peer Wellness Advocates. Find out more at University Health Service’s
Duck Nest.
University Counseling Services (UCS) has a team of dedicated staff members to support you with
your concerns, many of whom can provide identity-based support. All clinical services are free and
confidential. Find out more at Counseling Services or by calling 541-346-3227 (anytime UCS is
closed, the After-Hours Support and Crisis Line is available by calling this same number).
Help for Victims and Survivors
If you are a victim or survivor of sexual assault, sexual harassment, dating or domestic violence,
gender-based harassment or bullying, and/or stalking and need help, start at the Help for Victims
and Survivors page. There is staff available 24-hours a day for confidential advice and assistance.
Even if you are unsure what to do, call 541-346-7233 (SAFE) and you’ll be connected with
somebody who will listen to you and help guide you as you figure out what you want to do next. We
are here to support you and help provide the assistance and services you need.
Bias Education and Response Team
The University of Oregon Bias Education and Response Team (BERT), based in the Office of the
Dean of Students, works to provide those who have witnessed, or themselves become a target of an
act of bias, an opportunity to be heard and supported. The fundamental role of BERT is to respond
to situations that affect the larger University of Oregon community through education about current
and historical issues surrounding bias. Utilizing best practices in our field, the BERT provides services
to witness(es), bystander(s), targeted individual(s), offender(s), or a member(s) of the community
in order to create change in a timely, effective, and comprehensive way. It is through our education
services and initiatives that we hope to eliminate acts of bias within our community.
If you have witnessed or experienced bias and would like more information or would like to report it,
please visit the Bias Education and Response Team page.
Title IX
If you or someone you know (student, faculty, or staff) has experienced gender discrimination,
sexual harassment, or sexual violence, the university can offer assistance, support, and
resources. Please see the How to Report page
Prohibited Discrimination and Harassment Reporting
Page 11 of 12

Any student who has experienced sexual assault, relationship violence, sex or gender-based
bullying, stalking, and/or sexual harassment may seek resources and help at the Help for Victims
and Survivors page. To get help by phone, a student can also call either the UO’s 24-hour hotline at
541-346-7244 (SAFE), or the non-confidential Title IX Coordinator at 541-346-8136. From the SAFE
website, students may also connect to Callisto, a confidential, third-party reporting site that is not a
part of the university.
Students experiencing any other form of prohibited discrimination or harassment can find
information at the University’s Respect page or the University’s Equal Access page or contact
the non-confidential of Affirmative Action and Equal Opportunity (AAEO) office at 541-346-3123 or
the Dean of Students Office at 541-346-3216 for help. As UO policy has different reporting
requirements based on the nature of the reported harassment or discrimination, additional
information about reporting requirements for discrimination or harassment unrelated to sexual
assault, relationship violence, sex or gender based bullying, stalking, and/or sexual harassment is
available at Discrimination & Harassment.
Specific details about confidentiality of information and reporting obligations of employees can be
found at the University’s Equal Access page.
Emergency Response
Active shooter
In the unlikely event of an active shooter on campus, all students should “run – hide – fight.” Our
first line of defense will be to run from the classroom and away from campus. (You are to get
yourself to safety. There will be no class meeting spot in this emergency.) If running is not an
option, attempt to hide in the classroom by turning off the lights and getting on the ground. If
hiding is not an option, fight the active shooter by throwing objects at his/her eyes (books, laptops,
water bottles, etc.) and then tackling him/her until help arrives.
Earthquake or Fire for Eugene Students
Leave the building by the nearest, safe exit and gather on the north side of Lillis by the wind
sculpture.
Earthquake or Fire for Portland Students
Leave the building by the nearest, safe exit and gather next to the memorial statue on the
waterfront lawn.
I reserve the right to change any of this information due to unforeseen circumstances or
to better meet the goals of the course.
