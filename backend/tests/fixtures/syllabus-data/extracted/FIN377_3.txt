Course Objectives
The primary objective of the Security Analysis class in the Financial Analyst Program is to build
an understanding of the concepts and tools needed to conduct high-quality financial analysis. The
issues we consider will be directly applicable for those interested in investment banking, private
equity, venture capital, asset management, corporate finance, and consulting. We will cover topics
in valuation (including business model evaluation and advanced valuation techniques), financing,
risk management, mergers and acquisitions, and the private-capital business (private equity and
venture capital).
Course Materials
There is no textbook for this course. These slides effectively represent the textbook for the course.
They should be fairly self-contained and complete, though you may want to supplement them with
notes during class. An incomplete version of the slides will be available on Canvas before class.
The complete version will be available after class. There is also a course pack containing published
cases that we will analyze during the semester as well as reading material that supplements and
expands upon the material we will cover in the class. You can pay for and access the course pack
on the Harvard Business School publishing website. The link for the coursepack is:
https://hbsp.harvard.edu/import/604518
Teams
At some point near the beginning of the semester, you should form self-selected teams of exactly
four people. Each team will work together on the cases we cover in class (see below) as well as
on a stock pitch that you will present in the Fall. If you would like assistance in forming or finding
a team, please let me know. Once you have formed a team, please email me to let me know who
1

is on it. Once chosen, these teams are permanent except under extraordinary circumstances. If
somebody on your team drops out of FAP for whatever reason, you can continue with a team of
three.
Work for MBA Investment Fund
As part of the FAP program, you will work as analysts for the McCombs MBA Investment Fund.
The commitment here should be no more than an hour or two per week. More details on the nature
of these analyst arrangements to follow.
Evaluation
There is no grade distribution requirement for this course. I will calculate final grades for the
course as a weighted average of the following components, with weights to the right of each
component and further details below:
Cases (in groups) 20%
Problem sets (in groups) 20%
Term paper 5%
Exams 45%
Attendance and participation 10%
Cases (20% of grade)
Harvard Business School-style cases are useful for evaluating financial decision-making in
anecdotal settings where, through the efforts of a case-writer, we have access to more information
than we normally would. We will read and carefully analyze multiple cases during the course of
the semester. We will devote one class period to the discussion of each case, with the exception
of the Teuer case, which we will not discuss in class.
Approximately one week before we discuss a case, I will provide you a set of questions relating to
that case. Each self-chosen team of four (see above) will then submit a case write-up addressing
these questions. The case write-up will be due by the beginning of the class period in which we
discuss the given case (the first of the two class periods in the case of the fifth case). With the
exception of the Spotify case, a case write-up should be no longer than five pages, double-spaced,
plus any exhibits. The write-up for the Spotify case should be no more than two pages, double-
spaced, and should not include any exhibits. You should submit each case write-up to the course
Canvas site in a single pdf file.
Each case write-up will be graded on a 10-point scale. With the exception of the Spotify case,
cases will be graded based on the quality and presentation of the analysis. The Spotify case write-
up is for a completion grade, though evidence of a lack of effort on that write-up will result in less
than full credit.

A few tips on analyzing cases and preparing case write-ups in general:
 Be careful not to be too “drawn in” by the narrative of the case. You are generally
hearing the details of the case from the perspective of the “protagonists,” i.e., the subjects
of the case. They are not unbiased. Your job is to conduct a cold, careful analysis of the
case. Be skeptical. Think carefully about any argument you are weighing. Look at the
evidence.
 Avoid summarizing too many of the background details from the case. You just need to
provide enough background for the reader to understand the nature of your analysis and
the bases for your conclusions.
 State all of the assumptions behind your analysis clearly and completely. Nothing is
more disconcerting when reading a piece of analysis than having a key number or
calculation appear out of thin air without justification or explanation.
 Writing quality matters. Being able to express ideas clearly is a valuable skill. Work on
honing it. Also, whether fair or not, people will judge you by your writing. People
naturally interpret word misspellings, jumbled grammar, non-sequitors, and text that feels
unedited as evidence of sloppiness, and those associations can bleed over into their
perception of the quality of your analytical work.
Problem sets (20% of grade)
Problem sets are useful for giving you an opportunity to apply some of the concepts from the class
in a stylized setting, stripped of real-world complexity and for evaluating your understanding of
these concepts. They are also useful for giving you an opportunity to extend your learning beyond
the material we cover in class. We will tentatively have five problem sets due during the course
of the semester.
I will provide you with a problem set approximately one week before it is due. You will work in
teams of four on the problem sets, with each team turning in one solution. Unlike for the cases, I
will randomly assign you to teams of four to work on a problem set, reconstituting new teams for
each problem set. Working on the problem sets in these teams will give you a chance to expand
your network within your FAP cohort. You should submit your problem set answers to the course
Canvas site in a single pdf file. You are free to handwrite these answers and scan them into a pdf
file, as long as the handwriting is legible. Problem sets are due by the beginning of class on their
due dates. Shortly after the class period in which a problem set is due, I will post a solution to the
problem set to Canvas.
Each problem set will be graded on a 100-point scale. Many problems will involve at least some
quantitative analysis, though a few will be purely qualitative. I will grant partial credit. The
emphasis will be more on evaluating whether you appear to understand the concepts relevant to a
problem than on whether you reach the correct answer. The specific problems that I will ask you
to solve in the problem sets will be closely connected to material we have discussed in class. If
you are unsure how to proceed on a problem, find the relevant material in the slides. If you are
still unsure, contact me.

Term paper (5%)
Near the end of the semester, you will submit a brief “term paper.” This paper should reflect your
inquiry into some subject in finance that you find interesting and that you think others might find
interesting as well. You have a lot of latitude in your choice of topic. Be creative. Think about
something you saw in the financial news recently that you thought looked interesting. An example
of a topic suggested by a past student is the effect of Brexit on the VC industry in the UK (you
may not use this topic). Feel free to bounce ideas for topics off of me.
The term paper should be no longer than five pages, double-spaced, plus any exhibits. The term
paper should be based on your research into your topic. It should provide background on the topic
as well as any conclusions that you have reached. I will grade the term paper on how clear and
detailed a picture you paint of the setting behind your topic and how well you found any arguments
you make in drawing a particular conclusion. I will also give you credit for how ambitious a topic
you decide to tackle. The term paper must be new. You may not submit a term paper that borrows
heavily from any essay you have written in another class.
Exams (45%)
We will have three exams during the semester. Exams will be closed book. Exams I and II will
each be limited to material in a subset that I will specify once we get close to the time of the exam.
Exam III will be comprehensive, i.e., any material we covered during the semester is fair game.
However, I will not ask you questions on any exam that require you to recall any specific details
from one of the four cases we discussed during the semester. Each of the three exams will receive
equal weight towards the final grade.
Attendance and participation (10%)
You should be in class if at all possible. Your presence and involvement make the class more
fulfilling for everybody else in the class. You should also be there by the start of class at 3:30 pm.
Having people continuing to trickle into the room after class starts is disruptive and avoidable.
Unexcused absences are unacceptable. If you are unable to attend class on a given day or if you
will need to arrive late or leave early, please email me in advance and let me know.
We will manage attendance using an app called Arkaive. You can download this app for iOS or
Android (it might be available for mac and/or pc as well). You need to enroll in the class on the
app. The enrollment code is ZX41. When you arrive in class each day, please check in through
the app so that your presence is recorded.
The discussion in class will be interactive. We will use slides as a basis for much of the discussion,
but I will ask you a lot of questions as we go. Some of these questions are designed to be sure that
we are all on the same page. Others will be challenging questions that are designed to generate
discussion and to lead us to insights. I also expect you to have questions. If you do not fully
understand something that we cover, it is a near-certainty that other people in the class do not fully
understand it either. So, you generally help everybody by asking questions. Disagreements will
arise sometimes during the course of discussion. These disagreements are healthy. I simply ask
that we all maintain a level of respect for each other in the dialogue.

No laptops, cell phones, or tablets may be out and open during class, except for following slides
and note-taking. The use of electronics for other purposes during class tends to distract everybody
sitting around you (more than you might realize).
Please participate fully. You will get more out of the class, and you will make the class more
fulfilling for everybody else. I will keep track of who participates and the quality of that
participation over the course of the semester, and these will factor into the attendance and
participation portion of the grade.
I will also communicate with the MBA Fund managers to verify that you have been diligent in
your work as an analyst for the fund. This assessment will factor into the participation grade as
well.
Grade disputes
If you feel that there is an objective error in the way a problem is graded or a miscalculation of the
grade for an assignment, please let me know so that I can look at it. If you wish to raise concerns
about the subjective grading of a question or assignment, then you must submit your specific
concerns to me in writing, and I will consider them. I have two graders (PhD students) who will
grade most of the assignments and exams. These graders have both been grading for me for some
time and have shown excellent judgement and understanding of the material. I will only overturn
their judgement if the case is clear.
Activities outside of class
In addition to our class sessions, we will also learning and networking opportunities outside of
class. These will include a modelling session, a joint FAP junior/senior lunch, and the annual
meeting of the FAP Advisory Council, among other events. Attendance at these activities is
mandatory, unless you have another class that conflicts with them. If you have such a conflict,
please let me know as far in advance as possible. You will get a lot out of these activities.
Caveat
The set of topics we will cover in this class is more or less fixed, but there is still uncertainty about
the amount of time we will devote to each topic, optimal pacing, the timing and nature of
assignments, and the timing and nature of learning opportunities and other activities outside of the
classroom. As a result, many of the details of the course described in this syllabus – especially in
the schedule at the end of the syllabus – are fluid will change during the course of the semester.
The version of the syllabus on Canvas will always be current and will display the date on which it
was most recently updated in the upper right-hand corner. I would welcome any feedback you
have along the way on how the course is going, what you find difficult, what you would like to see
more of, etc.
