Fall 2024
Instructor: Prof. Emanuel Tutuc; Office: EER 3.890, MER 2.606E; E-mail:
etutuc@mail.utexas.edu.
Class hours: MW 1:30pm – 3:00pm, ECJ 1.306

Description:
Advances in technology and fabrication of semiconductor structures have led
to devices with size smaller that the electron mean free path. This course
covers the theoretical framework for understanding the electronic properties of
low-dimensional semiconductor structures, electron transport in quantum
confined devices, such as semiconductor heterostructures, quantum wires and
quantum dots.
Objectives:
 Review a number of key nanoscale, quantum confined electronic
devices.
 Understand the electronic properties of nanostructures.
 Understand the device physics of semiconductor nanotransistors.
Prerequisites:
Quantum mechanics and solid state physics (undergraduate level) are strongly
recommended.

Grading:
30% Homework, 30% Midterm, 40% Final.
Homework questions will be assigned throughout the class term, and will be
due one to two weeks after being assigned.
Late homework will be accepted at instructor’s discretion. Discussion of
homework questions is encouraged. Please be sure to
submit your own independent homework solution.
Midterm exam date: TBD.
The final exam dates are set by the registrar’s office, and made public four
weeks before the semester ends http://registrar.utexas.edu/students/exams/.
This course counts toward the Graduate Portfolio in Nanomanufacturing
(https://nascent.utexas.edu/nanomanufacturing-portfolio-program)
Course notes:
Course notes will be provided for most lectures. The web-based course
management system “Canvas”, available at https://canvas.utexas.edu/ will be
used to post course notes, homework assignments and solutions.
College Drop/Add Policy:
An engineering student must have Dean’s approval to add/drop after the fourth
class day of the semester.
Academic dishonesty:
Plagiarism or any form of academic dishonesty (cheating includes, but is not
limited to, copying another student's work, bringing notes into a test and
copying material directly from a book, article or web site without including
appropriate references, falsifying data, doing someone's work) is a violation of
University rules and may return a grade of zero for each assignment in which
it is detected or may incur even steeper penalties. For University policies see:
http://registrar.utexas.edu/catalogs/gi09-10/ch01/index.html

Class Web sites and student privacy:
Web-based, password-protected class sites are associated with all academic
courses taught at The University. Syllabi, handouts, assignments and other
resources are types of information that may be available within these sites. Site
activities could include exchanging e-mail, engaging in class discussions and
chats, and exchanging files. In addition electronic class rosters will be a
component of the sites. Students do not want their names included in these
electronic class rosters must restrict their directory information in the Office of
the Registrar, Main Building, Room 1.
Students with Disabilities:
The University of Texas at Austin provides upon request appropriate academic
accommodations for qualified students with disabilities. For more information,
contact the Division of Diversity and Community Engagement, Services for
Students with Disabilities at 471-6259
(http://www.utexas.edu/diversity/ddce/ssd/).
Accommodations for religious holidays:
Section 51.911 of the Texas Education Code addresses absence by students
for observance of religious holidays. Section 51.911 states that a student shall
be excused from attending classes or other required activities, including
examinations, for the observance of a religious holy day, including travel for
that purpose. A student whose absence is excused under this subsection may
not be penalized for that absence and shall be allowed to take an examination
or complete an assignment from which the student is excused within a
reasonable time after the absence. University policy requires students to notify
each of their instructors as far in advance of the absence as possible so that
arrangements can be made. By UT Austin policy, you must notify the instructor
of your pending absence at least fourteen days prior to the date of observance
of a religious holiday.
Recommendations regarding emergency evacuation from the Office of Campus
Safety and Security (http://www.utexas.edu/safety/):
- Occupants of buildings on The University of Texas at Austin campus are
required to evacuate buildings when a fire alarm is activated. Alarm activation
or announcement requires exiting and assembling outside.
- Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of each classroom and building you
may occupy. Remember that the nearest exit door may not be the one you
used when entering the building.
- Students requiring assistance in evacuation shall inform their instructor in
writing during the first week of class.
- In the event of an evacuation, follow the instruction of faculty or class
instructors; exit in an orderly fashion and assemble outside.

- Do not re-enter a building unless given instructions by the following: Austin
Fire Department, The University of Texas at Austin Police Department, or Fire
Prevention Services office.
- Behavior Concerns Advice Line (BCAL): 512-232-5050
