Course overview
1. This course offers a variety of experiments designed to help you:
 learn data techniques,
 learn error analysis techniques,
 communicate your work to other scientists
 receive an introduction to basic experimental methods of physical chemistry,
 apply various theories important in physical chemistry to the collected data,
 compare results with literature values,
 think about the meanings of the underlying theory and the answers obtained.
2. Experimental emphasis is on measurements of thermodynamic, kinetic, and physical properties and are
run in round-robin fashion.
Course materials
 CH153K lab manual, available on Bb>Master Ch153K Course> Course Documents
 C.W. Garland, J.W. Nibler and D.P. Shoemaker, Experiments in Physical Chemistry, any edition (If
8th, get the UT Custom edition)
 Lab notebook with duplicate numbered pages, we recommend buying from ACS in the Grand Hall.
Attendance
You are expected to be on time and attend every lab session. Due to our open scheduling system, there
are no specific make-up dates. You are also required to take a full two sessions for each experiment. If
you have finished the in-lab portion, work on your data analysis or report writing in the computer lab.
Computers
 Computers are provided in the lab where needed for experimentation, and in our computer room
(WEL 4.136) for analysis. All labs have wireless access.
 We will use Blackboard http://courses.utexas.edu/, where your grades are posted. Also electronic
reserves for some of the necessary references are available there. Any not available are on reserve in
the Mallet Library.
 All communications concerning this course will be sent exclusively through the Bb mailing list, with
the expectation that you will check your email and Bb Announcements daily. It is your responsibility to update
UTDirect with any changes in email address.

 We suggest you use UT WebSpace http://webspace.utexas.edu/ to store all computer files generated by
this course for the duration of the semester.

Note: basic policy information for both CH 153K & 154K is found in Chapter 1. Chapter 2 contains
policies that apply solely to CH 154K. Section 1.3 of the manual contains information on course grading,
and the late penalty system is available in Section 1.4.4. All report grades are available on Bb, protected using
your UTEID. It is your responsibility to check your grades regularly. Grades are not curved; therefore we
expect an absolute level of achievement to attain a certain grade. You will be graded by all course TAs and
effort is made to ensure consistency between graders. There is no final exam for this course.
This course carries the Writing Flag. Writing Flag courses are designed to give students experience with writing in an
academic discipline. In this class, you can expect to write regularly during the semester, complete substantial writing projects, and
receive feedback from your instructor to help you improve your writing. You will also have the opportunity to revise one or more
assignments. You should therefore expect a substantial portion of your grade to come from your written work.
Estimated maximum grade cutoffs (points, not percentages):
A ≥90 C 73 - <77
A- 89 - <90 C- 70 - <73
B+ 87 - <89 D+ 65 - <70
B 83 - <87 D 60 - <65
B- 80 - <83 D- 55 - <60
C+ 77 - <80 F < 55
Due to the plus/minus grading system, grade cutoffs are absolute, and NO ROUNDING WILL
OCCUR. Due to the smaller range for each grade level, it is all the more imperative for you to be proactive
about any grading questions immediately. Scrounging for points at the end of term will not be tolerated, so
be sure to get any grade clarification from the grading TA as soon as possible, and do the work
necessary to reach your desired grade. Getting the grade you want is your job. Evaluating the quality of your
work is ours. Any changes at the end of semester will require PROOF of a SIGNIFICANT grading error.
Each experiment is graded based on the rubric on the summary sheet (available in the manual of
Bb). NOTE: failing to follow all directions results in point deductions apart from the rubric.
Lab Partners will turn in ONE report between them per experiment. Each partner will alternate
being the ‘lead author.’ The lead author is the one primarily responsible for the text of the report and any
error analysis, while the secondary author will be primarily responsible for the spreadsheet/calculations.
(This is one possible way to separate the work. We actually recommend team members work closely
together on all aspects of every experiment. It is expected that all team members will be fully capable of

discussing any aspect of any experiment at any time after the completion of the report.) Both will receive the
same grade, including the effect of any late points. You will each turn in an evaluation of your partner’s
contributions to the work. You will be working in groups throughout your career and it is important to learn
how to manage the workload and responsibility. Because you each receive the same grade, it is in your best
interest to stay involved, even if your partner is the lead author on a given report. When choosing a partner,
therefore, it is wise to choose one who shares your goals for the course. If you want an ‘A’, then don’t
choose someone just trying to get the ‘C-’. Remember, it is your job to obtain the education & earn the
grade for which you have paid. Be SURE that your will earn your desired grade BEFORE the end of the
semester. All grades in this course are earned, not given.
Turn-in Procedures and Late Policies
Turn in reports to your TA who will time stamp them. Also, turn in an electronic version of your
report through Bb’s SafeAssign no later than the due date/time of the hard copy.
In order to be properly submitted, your report must have the Report Summary Sheet (from Bb) as the
cover page, a printout of relevant electronic files, and the white sheets from your lab notebook placed at the
end. There must be two copies of the front page of the summary sheet, both filled out completely. Your TA
will keep one copy and return your report to you with the other copy.
You must attend 2 sessions/experiment. If you finish data collection the 1st session, you must work
on the analysis/report in the computer lab during the 2nd. If you turn in the report early, you can leave.
All due dates are as posted on the course calendar included with this syllabus, on Blackboard, or
posted outside the lab. To be on time, an assignment must be submitted within the first 15 minutes of the
start of your lab period. After this, you will lose 20 points, and continue to lose 20 points per day until a
grade of 0 (zero) is reached. (Failure to turn in the report to SafeAssign will result in a 10 pt/day penalty.)
Weekends, school holidays, or emergency closures of the University do not count as late days. If the
University is closed when an assignment is due, then it will be due on the first day the school reopens.
Once your report is turned in, it will be given to the grading TA, and it should be graded in no more
than 1 session and returned to your TA who will return it to you. You MAY keep it, provided you have
submitted a copy to SafeAssign AND the TA has a complete copy of the front page of the Summary Sheet.
If you do not get it back in a timely fashion, please let the Lab Director know which report and due date
seem to be missing.
If you have a concern about your grade, you may request a regrade within 2 sessions of that grade’s
posting. On a cover sheet, clearly explain your question and the reason you feel there is a mistake. Be
specific, and resubmit it to the grader. If after reconsideration you still have concerns, see the Lab Director.
Make-Up Policies
If you have an extenuating circumstance, tell your TA. If and only if your TA is impressed with your
sob story or your outrageous creativity, s/he will make appropriate comments on your Report Summary Sheet.
NOTHING will be accepted after 5 p.m. on Friday, December 7. NO EXCEPTIONS. DON’T
ASK. A student once lost her 4.0 because she didn’t take this seriously.
If there is a conflict with an exam for another class or similar, per CNS policy, it is expected that the
other professor offer a make-up time as they scheduled their exam outside of the scheduled class time. You
are registered for this class at this time and this take precedence.
The fall schedule does not allow for extra time. It is vital that you attend all sessions and remain
caught up. If something comes up, discuss it with your TA ASAP.
Appeals
Our teaching assistants will make decisions concerning grades, attendance and other policy matters. Should
you disagree with a TA, you are welcome to take the matter to the Lab Director.
Safety & Waste Disposal
Safe lab practices and waste disposal procedures are described in the lab manual. Unsafe, imprudent and
careless activities will result in you being removed from the lab. Continued noncompliance could result in a
reduced lab grade or course failure.

Accommodations
Students with disabilities who need special accommodations should notify the instructor at the beginning of the semester by
presenting a letter from the SSD office (471-6259). “The University of Texas at Austin provides upon request appropriate
academic accommodations for qualified students with disabilities. For more information, contact the Office of the Dean of
Students at 471-6259, 471-6441 TTY.”
Religious Observances
By UT Austin policy, you must notify me of your pending absence at least fourteen days prior to the date of observance of a
religious holy day. If you must miss a class, an examination, a work assignment, or a project in order to observe a religious holy
day, you will be given an opportunity to complete the missed work within a reasonable time after the absence.
One-time Drop Policy
Students have the option once in their undergraduate degree to drop a class or drop out of all classes in a semester right up til the
last class day. This policy is available at http://www.utexas.edu/faculty/council/2010-2011/legislation/EPC_OTE.html and was
proposed and approved by UT Faculty Council on May 9, 2011. According to the policy as approved by the Provost, a student
who has completed at least two long semesters here at UT can drop a class only if he or she has an average grade of D+ or below
in the class at the time of the request and if there are no pending investigations of scholastic dishonesty for the course in question.
Academic Integrity
Scholastic dishonesty will not be tolerated in this course. For a detailed discussion of our expectations of you, see Section 1.2
Scholastic Dishonesty in your lab manual. For definitions of unacceptable behaviour, such as plagiarism, and the UT policy
regarding such activities, see the Student Judicial Services website: http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/academicintegrity.html
Emergency Evacuations
- Occupants of buildings on The University of Texas at Austin campus are required to evacuate buildings when a fire alarm is
activated. Alarm activation or announcement requires exiting and assembling outside following staff instructions.
- Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of each classroom and building you may occupy. Remember that the nearest exit door
may not be the one you used when entering the building.
- Students requiring assistance in evacuation shall inform their instructor in writing during the first week of class.
- In the event of an evacuation, follow the instruction of faculty or class instructors.
- Do not re-enter a building unless given instructions by the following: Austin Fire Department, The University of Texas at Austin
Police Department, Fire Prevention Services office, or the Office of Campus Safety and Security, 512-471-5767,
http://www.utexas.edu/safety/. Link to information regarding emergency evacuation routes and emergency procedures can be
found at: www.utexas.edu/emergency
Writing Center
Writing Center: I strongly encourage you to use the Undergraduate Writing Center, FAC 211, 471-6222:
http://www.uwc.utexas.edu). The Undergraduate Writing Center offers free, individualized, expert help with writing for any UT
undergraduate, by appointment or on a drop-in basis. Any undergraduate enrolled in a course at UT can visit the UWC for
assistance with any writing project. They work with students from every department on campus, for both academic and non-
academic writing. Whether you are writing a lab report, a resume, a term paper, a statement for an application, or your own
poetry, UWC consultants will be happy to work with you. Their services are not just for writing with "problems." Getting
feedback from an informed audience is a normal part of a successful writing project. Consultants help students develop strategies
to improve their writing. The assistance they provide is intended to foster independence. Each student determines how to use the
consultant's advice. The consultants are trained to help you work on your writing in ways that preserve the integrity of your work.
