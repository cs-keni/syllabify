Course Overview: Human Microscopic and Gross Anatomy (BIO 446L) is an upper division lecture and
lab course designed for biology majors. This course will provide students with an intensive survey of the
microscopic and gross anatomy of various human tissues and organs. The course will use a systems
approach, with an emphasis on integrated structure-function relationships at the cell, tissue and organ
level. Lecture and lab study materials will include a virtual microscopic slide library, animal tissue for
dissection, skeletons, models, and video film clips of human cadaver dissections. On completion of the
course, students will be able to identify and describe: the different types of human tissues, the structure
and location of different organs, their specific functions, and their relationships with each other in the
human body.
This semester you have the opportunity to dive deeply into the intriguing field of human anatomy and
physiology. It can be one of the most satisfying subjects you will ever study because it brings together so
much material you have learned from other courses and it can be applied to understand so much that you
encounter in your daily life. You will certainly use both the facts and the skills you develop in this course
in your future careers. Have an open, engaged mind, work hard and ENJOY!

(PLUS) team will be supporting Bio446L this semester. Study group times and locations will be provided
the second week of class during lecture and will also be posted on Blackboard. If you would like to
become a preceptor (study group leader) for Bio446L this semester, applications will be handed out
during lecture and will be posted on Blackboard. You are strongly encouraged to take advantage of
1

these organized study groups. Students that participated in these study groups in the past found them to
be very beneficial and have significantly improved performance in the class. For more information on the
PLUS study groups go http://www.utexas.edu/student/utlc/study_groups/.
Course Objectives: This course is as much about how to learn as it is about human anatomy and
physiology and requires that you are able to understand the material as well as memorize it. Students
who complete this class should be able to:
1. Explain the inseparable relationship between microscopic structure and function, and be able to apply
that understanding to new situations.
2. Use systematic, logical thinking processes to correctly identify tissues at the microscopic level.
3. Identify and describe gross anatomical and microscopic anatomical details of the major tissues, organs,
and organ systems of the human body.
4. Explain the functions of the organ and the mechanisms that allow the organ to carry out its functions.
5. Compare and contrast physiological processes in various organ systems.
6. Integrate the various overlapping various physiological processes that maintain homeostasis.
7. Explain the 3-dimensional complexity of the human body as evidenced by the relational positions of
major organs.
8. Use anatomical terminology of the major body regions and its cavities, and the directions and planes of
section of the human body to communicate 3-dimensional complexity accurately and succinctly to
others.
9. Read relevant scientific literature, applying anatomical nomenclature and concepts.
10. Organize, memorize, and integrate significant amounts of information.
11. Recognize what you do not understand.
12. Improve critical reading skills.
13. Maintain composure and focus when faced with problem solving and questions on material you have
not studied directly.
14. Cooperate with classmates and work effectively in teams.
15. Enjoy the opportunity to examine in detail the fascinating workings of the human body.

IMPORTANT NOTE: If prompted for payment information for your particular class, Blackboard needs
to use pop-up windows to get you through the payment portion of the enrollment. You must have all pop-
up blockers turned off for this portion of the procedure. Please turn off pop-up blocking or use another
browser or computer that does not have blocking. If you have any questions, log on to
www.einstruction.com and use the Customer Support menu option. In the past, students registering
their response pads using Macintosh computers have had difficulty completing the payment process. This
last step appears to be browser sensitive. Students have remedied this problem by registering on the
Mozilla Firefox web browser. eInstruction technical support at 888-333-7532.
Exams: There will be four lecture exams during the semester, and a comprehensive lecture final exam.
Tests will cover factual material, but also emphasize application and synthesis of material, anatomical
relationships, physiological processes and problem solving. You may be asked to apply your knowledge
in a scenario that was not specifically discussed. You may NOT use an alphanumeric calculator, iPod or
related device, or a cell phone during an exam.
Students may be assigned to specific seats in the exam room. If so, you must sit in your assigned seat or
risk being counted absent. Seat assignments will be posted in the exam room.
Students with a conflicting University class or examination must submit a request for a different test time
in writing at least one week prior to the scheduled date of the exam. The request must state the class
number, meeting time, and professor’s name. People taking non-UT classes such as MCAT prep courses
are not allowed to take early exams. Students with a conflict will take the exam in the 2-5 pm time frame
the afternoon of the scheduled test day. The University of Texas at Austin provides upon request
appropriate academic accommodations for qualified students with disabilities. For more information,
contact the Office of the Dean of Students at 471-6259, 471-4641 TTY.
The University of Texas at Austin provides upon request appropriate academic accommodations for
qualified students with disabilities. For more information, contact the Office of the Dean of Students at
471-6259, 471-4641 TTY. In addition, inform Dr. Findell one week before the first exam that you will
need special accommodations.

Missed exams: A missed exam will be excused only if: 1) the student can produce a verifiable, written
medical excuse OR there has been a verifiable death in the immediate family, AND 2) the student has
contacted the instructor PRIOR to the exam. You may email or leave a phone message as soon as you
realize you must miss an exam. Again, no makeup exam will be given; you must take the final exam.
There will be no makeup exams. No exceptions. Students who have an EXCUSED absence for an
exam (see above), will use the score earned on the final exam to make up for the missed lecture
exam score.
Exam regrades: Questions about grading on the tests must be taken up with the TA or the instructor no
later than 1 week after the test is returned. This includes questions about addition/subtraction/
multiplication errors. If you wish to contest an answer, you must submit a written request with an
explanation of why you feel your answer is correct and warrants additional credit. Be sure you have
ample justification. For any re-grades other than arithmetic errors, the entire test will be regraded and
you may lose points as well as gain them. If there is any question that the student has altered the exam
after getting it back, there will be no credit given for the answer. Tests written in pencil will not be
regraded if there is any sign of erasure. Tests with “white-out” will not be regraded. The key for each
lecture exam will be posted in Blackboard.
Bio 446L Grade distribution:
Lecture midterm exams (4) 40%
Lecture final exam 20%
Classwork (CPS) 5%
Lecture total 65%
Lab exams (2) 25%
Lab quizzes 5%
Lab attendance and participation 5%
Lab total 35%
Grades will be on a 10 point scale as follows (with values of 0.5 or above rounded up):
90 -100 = A 80 - 89 = B 70 - 79 = C 60 - 69 = D 0 - 59 = F
This semester the Plus/Minus system for grading will be applied in Bio446L. Full letter grades, letter
grades plus or letter grades minus will be determined and submitted. The cutoffs for letter grade pluses
and minuses will be determined at the end of the semester.
In the event that the overall performance of the class dictates a final grade curve, the new grade cutoffs
will not be rounded up. For example, if 78% is the final average required for a letter B grade, a 77.5 will
NOT be rounded up to 78%. Rather, a 78.0 will be the minimum final grade average required for a B.
Classwork: These will include lecture CPS quizzes and CPS problems done in class. These class
problems will provide the opportunity for you to practice complex problem solving. They can also help
reveal misconceptions and misunderstanding in time to correct them before an exam.
It is the student’s responsibility to make sure his or her remote pad is properly enrolled in Bio416K and
functioning correctly. It is strongly recommended that each student check the scores of his or her first
few CPS quizzes as a means to determine if their remote pad is functioning correctly. Scores from the
CPS quizzes can be found on Gradebook. Students are also encouraged to regularly check their CPS quiz
4

scores throughout the entire semester to make sure their remote pad is continuing to function correctly.
Their will be no make up CPS quizzes and no adjustments made to the final CPS points due to an
incorrectly enrolled or malfunctioning remote pad.
Bio446L Laboratory: Attendance in all lab sessions is mandatory. Labs cannot be made up except
during the four days in which they are regularly scheduled. If you are ill, you should contact your lab T.A.
immediately about missed lab material.
Academic Integrity: It is expected that you will aspire to absolute academic integrity. All cases of
academic dishonesty will be reported to the Dean of Students for inclusion in your academic file,
which renders your chance for professional programs effectively nil. Ignorance of what constitutes
academic dishonesty is not an excuse. The standards of academic integrity and conduct are described by
the Dean of Students Office of Judicial Services: http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/.
The following policies will be in effect for all tests and quizzes:
1. Students may be assigned to specific seats in the exam room. If so, seat assignments will be posted
at the door to the room on exam days.
2. You must have a non-alphanumeric calculator for the exam. You will need a calculator with a
logarithmic function.
3. No talking except to the instructor.
4. Eyes on your own paper, not your neighbor's. If you want to think with your eyes off your paper,
look at the ceiling. Students with wandering eyes will be moved to another seat.
5. Books, backpacks, coats, etc. must be placed at the front of the room. Purses beneath your seat. No
hats except baseball caps turned backwards.
6. Do not write exams in red or pink ink. No "white-out."
7. All electronic devices, such as cell phones, pagers, radios, must be turned off and placed at the front
of the room.
8. No one will leave the room once the exam has started unless she/he has finished the exam.
