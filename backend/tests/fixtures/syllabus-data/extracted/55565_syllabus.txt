Instructor: Professor Vernita Gordon, gordon@chaos.utexas.edu, office RLM 14.206. Office Hours
Thursday 1pm-2pm, Friday 1pm-2pm, or by appointment. Email me to request an appointment.
Graduate Teaching Assistant: Layla Bakhtiari, labpuddle@gmail.com. Office hours Tuesdays 1:30pm-
3:30pm.
This course is calculus-based mechanics for science majors, including physics
majors. There are other introductory mechanics courses for engineering
students, pre-medical students, and to meet the general education science
requirement. Some of these are calculus-based and some are not. Please double-
check your major’s requirements to see if this class is required, or if there is
another course you should take that would be better-fit to your major.
This course will be taught using an interactive approach, called Peer Instruction.
You should not to expect material to be introduced in a classroom lecture. I will
spend very little time on lecture and you are expected to study the material
ahead of time, by reading the textbook and/or watching online lectures. I use this
teaching method because my own measurements and a great deal of peer-
reviewed, published education research show that student in Peer Instruction
courses learn more than do students in lecture courses. For your success, it is
important that you commit to doing your part, namely preparing for class ahead
of time and actively, inquisitively participating in classroom discussions.
Recitation Sessions: Recitation sessions are an opportunity for you to deepen
your understanding of concepts, to see example problems worked, and to work
on your homework with your classmates in an environment where a TA and LA
are also present to help you with questions. Recitation sessions will be held
weekly. The times for recitation sections will be set using a Doodle poll of the
class. If you have not gotten a link to this poll, please tell the instructor or TA
immediately.
Pick at least one recitation section and commit to weekly participation. This is
one of the most important things you can do to get a good grade.

Suggestions for how to study for this class (Please read these sections carefully!):
Before coming to class, read the assigned material. Daily reading is indicated in
the schedule at the end of this document. Work through the checkup questions
at the end of each section as you read though. Once you’ve gotten an answer you
think is right, check it against the answer at the end of the chapter. It is important
to understand the reasoning behind the answer, and not just be satisfied with
getting the “right” answer through erroneous reasoning. Take the online checkup
quiz on the textbook’s website. Make note of what concepts are giving you
difficulty. Review the Examples from the textbook. These provide concrete
illustrations of the concepts discussed, starting from simple examples and going
to more complex. Work through the online concept tutorials that are indicated
in the margins of your textbook.
In class, participate actively in the in-class discussion. Don’t be satisfied just with
getting the “right” answer. Having correct reasoning and correct use of the
concepts is much more important than getting the “right” answer. Discuss
reasoning and concepts with your neighbors even if you all got the same initial
answer.
Before the test, work through the checkup questions again. Take the online
checkup quiz on the textbook’s website again. Review the notes you took in
class. Work through the online tutorials on concepts that are giving you trouble.
If a concept or concepts is giving you trouble, come talk with the instructor, the
TA, or a LA. Don’t wait until just before the test – seek out help as soon as you
realize that you’re not understanding a concept properly. You can come talk with
us during office hours, during recitation sections, or you can make an
appointment to see Prof. Gordon outside office hours. Her email address is
gordon@chaos.utexas.edu.
Some additional study resources that you can use:
Conceptual Physics, by Hewitt. There are copies in the UT library.

The MIT OpenCourseWare version of this course has Learning Activites that
include Self-Assessments you can use to check your understanding of the
concepts. http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/physics/8-01sc-physics-i-classical-
mechanics-fall-2010/Syllabus/
There are online Java applets, called “Physlets,” that can act as tutorials or
simulations for problems in physics. Some of these can help you learn concepts
because you can watch how things happen. There are many sites of these online.
A good place to start is
http://webphysics.davidson.edu/physletprob/ch8_problems/default.html
There are interactive, research-based simulations of many of the concepts we will
study online: phet.colorado.edu.
You can have Quest create custom reviews for you.
How to know how well you understand concepts:
Try tackling problems on your own. Then ask yourself, explicitly, what do I need
to know to solve this? What are the things I do know? Articulate more
specifically than just “I need to know how to solve this problem.”
Go over the midterm or homework and discuss or write about where you went
wrong. Use your own words to describe where you got stuck and what a strategy
would be for you to get un-stuck and solve the problem. You can do this with
other students, and/or during office hours with the instructor, TA, or LA.
For the midterm or homework questions that gave you trouble, try doing them
again from copies that don’t have answers or explanations. Can you do these
problems now? Can you make up similar problems of your own? Can you figure
out how to test the same concepts or problem-solving ideas with different
problems? Make up your own problems and then discuss them with other
students or the instructor/TA/LAs. If you disagree about what concept(s) a
problem tests, talk about this and find what is different between the problems
and what is similar.

Grading: Plus/minus grading will not be used. Course grades will be determined from assignments and
exams as follows: 10% homework, 60% midterm exams, 20% final exam, and 10% in-class iClicker
quizzes. Exams will cover material from both the classroom “peer instruction” time and the assigned
textbook reading indicated in the schedule below. Half of the iClicker quiz score will come from
participation, and will therefore measure attendance. The lowest homework score will be dropped. The
lowest two iClicker quiz scores will be dropped. The lowest midterm score will be dropped. The final
exam is required.
At any point in the semester, you can calculate your grade as follows:
Current average =
0.1(𝐻𝑜𝑚𝑒𝑤𝑜𝑟𝑘 𝑎𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑒)+0.3(𝐻𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑒𝑠𝑡 𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑚)+).3(𝑠𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑑−ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑒𝑠𝑡 𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑚)+0.1(𝑖𝐶𝑙𝑖𝑐𝑘𝑒𝑟 𝑎𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑒)+0.2(𝐹𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑙 𝑒𝑥𝑎𝑚 𝑎𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑒)
0.2 𝑖𝑓 𝑛𝑜 𝑒𝑥𝑎𝑚𝑠 ℎ𝑎𝑣𝑒 𝑏𝑒𝑒𝑛 𝑡𝑎𝑘𝑒𝑛,0.5 𝑖𝑓 𝑜𝑛𝑒 𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑚 ℎ𝑎𝑠 𝑏𝑒𝑒𝑛 𝑡𝑎𝑘𝑒𝑛,0.8 𝑖𝑓 𝑡𝑤𝑜 𝑜𝑟 𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑒𝑒 𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑚𝑠 ℎ𝑎𝑣𝑒 𝑏𝑒𝑒𝑛 𝑡𝑎𝑘𝑒𝑛,1 𝑎𝑓𝑡𝑒𝑟 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑓𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑙
Math Refreshers: The Sanger Learning Center offers math refresher courses early in the semester.
They are free for UT students, and you can register here:
https://utdirect.utexas.edu/apps/ugs/my/events/. The calculus refresher is 9/5 – 9/7, 6-7:30pm. The
trigonometry refresher is 9/11 – 9/13, 6-7:30 pm. There is a 2-day algebra refresher 9/5 – 9/6 , 6-8 pm.
There is a 3-day algebra refresher 9/5 – 9/7, 6-7:30 pm.
The Sanger Learning Center also offers other courses on better studying, time management, and test-
taking.
Honor Code: The core values of the University of Texas at Austin are learning, discovery, freedom,
leadership, individual opportunity, and responsibility. Each member of the University is expected to
uphold these values through integrity, honesty, trust, fairness, and respect toward peers and
community.
Academic dishonesty: Academic dishonesty includes, but is not limited to, copying answers on exams
or homework, having another person do homework, exams, or iClicker quizzes for you, or bringing non-
allowed aids to exams. Collusion in another’s academic dishonesty is itself academically dishonest.
Generally speaking, academic dishonesty is any activity that misrepresents another person’s work as
one’s own, or that is intended to circumvent the intended purpose of evaluation tools like exams,
homework, and iClicker quizzes. Don’t do this. Cases of suspected academic dishonesty will be reported
to the Office of the Dean of Students.
Quest: You will do your homework in Quest. Homework will be assigned and graded through the online
QUEST system: http://cns.utexas.edu/quest/support/student. If you make random guesses on
homework assignments, your grade will on average be zero. Therefore, there are negative grades on
QUEST homework assignments. See the description of grading on the QUEST website. There will be no
negative grades on quizzes or exams. Quest also has some other quirks, including non-standard
handling of significant figures. Please read the introduction to Quest and the instructions on how to
enter answers carefully before beginning work. You don’t want to lose points because of a Quest quirk.

Paying for Quest: This course makes use of the web-based Quest content delivery and homework
server system maintained by the College of Natural Sciences. This homework service will require a $25
charge per student for its use, which goes toward the maintenance and operation of the resource.
Please go to http://quest.cns.utexas.edu to log in to the Quest system for this class. After the 12th day
of class, when you log into Quest you will be asked to pay via credit card on a secure payment site. You
have the option to wait up to 30 days to pay while still continuing to use Quest for your assignments. If
you are taking more than one course using Quest, you will not be charged more than $50/semester.
Quest provides mandatory instructional material for this course, just as is your textbook, etc. For
payment questions, email quest.billing@cns.utexas.edu.
iClickers: iClickers are required for this course. They may be purchased new or used. Do not register
your clicker on the iClicker website. Please register your iClicker remote in Canvas to participate in
in-class activities. Simply go to this class in Canvas, click the iClicker link in the menu, and enter
the remote ID that can be found on the back. iClicker registration in Canvas is required for course
enrollment. If you use your iClicker without registering, you will not get credit for your clicker response.
Textbook: Physics for Engineers and Scientists, 3rd Edition, Volume 1, by Ohanian and Markert. An
electronic version is available. Used copies are often available, in a bookstore or online. This textbook is
required. There is a website for the textbook with supplementary learning aids:
http://books.wwnorton.com/books/detail-students.aspx?ID=4591
Online Resource: M.I.T. has an open course on classical mechanics (Physics I):
http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/physics. Khan Academy has tutorials in much of the material covered in
this course (although not at a calculus-based level): https://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics
Email and Canvas: The instructor will sometimes communicate with the class through email, Quest,
and/or Canvas. These are official communications and may include information that could affect your
grade in the course. You are responsible for checking email at the address the University has on file for
you. You should do this at least daily. You are responsible for checking Canvas and Quest at least daily.
Pre-requisites: High school physics or consent of the undergraduate advisor; Mathematics 408C, or
408K and current enrollment in or credit for 408L.
Failing to satisfy Pre- and Co-requisites: Students who do not meet the pre- and co-requisites will get
an email on the first and fifth class days telling them to come into the Physics department to resolve the
problem. Failing to satisfy pre- and co-requisites can result in students being automatically dropped
from the course.
Class Seating and Materials: Please leave rows 3, 6, and 9 empty. Please sit in groups of three or four
so that you can work together. Always bring paper that you can write on and pen or paper to write
with. On some days, you will turn in short response papers at the end of class.
Tardiness and early departures: Tardiness and early departures are disruptive and distracting. Please
be seated before the bell rings and remain for the entire class. If there is an urgent reason why you

must leave early or come late, please sit on the aisle in a seat near the back, to minimize disruption to
your classmates, and please make sure the door closes softly for the same reason.
Cell phones and other electronic devices: Cell phones should always be silenced in the classroom. If
there is an urgent or emergency call that cannot wait until after class, please exit the classroom and
close the door before answering your phone. Please re-enter the classroom after the call in the way
described above to minimize disruption to your classmates. Laptop and tablet computers should be
silent in the classroom and should be used courteously. Cell phones, computers, graphing calculators,
and other electronic devices with potential for facilitating cheating are not allowed during exams.
Scientific calculators are allowed during exams.
Students with disabilities: Students with disabilities may request appropriate academic
accommodations from the Division of Diversity and Community Engagement, Services for Students with
Disabilities, 512-471-6259, http://www.utexas.edu/diversity/ddce/ssd. Students who need special
accommodation must notify the instructor no later than the 12th day of class.
Religious holidays: If you will miss class because of a religious holy day, you must notify the instructor
of your pending absence at least fourteen days prior to the date of observance of a religious holy day
and no later than the 12th day of class. If you must miss a class, an examination, a work assignment, or a
project in order to observe a religious holy day, you will be given an opportunity to complete the missed
work within a reasonable time after the absence.
Group study sessions: You are encouraged to organize a group study session. You may ask a Learning
Assistant to lead such a section. You can reserve a Group Study Room in PCL library by going to the
Library web site (www.lib.utexas.edu). Under the column “for students” click on “Reserve a Group
Study Room”. These rooms accommodate 6 or 12 people.
Working together on homework: You are encouraged to discuss problems with your classmates and
teach each other concepts and ways of approaching problems. However, each student must do his or
her own work when turning in homework answers on QUEST. Copying another student’s work or having
another student do the work for you is academic dishonesty.
UT Learning Center: The UT Learning Center in Jester has a variety of individual and group tutoring
services. The Learning Center also offers sessions on how to study physics.
Free Coaching: The Physics Department provides graduate student coaches to assist students in PHY
301 and other introductory courses. This coaching is available on a one-to-one basis. Coaching tables
are in the area by the elevators on the 5th floor of RLM. Since the RLM elevator does not stop on the 5th
floor, take the stairs or escalator one flight up from the ground floor (4th floor) to the coaching area on
the 5th floor. Coaching hours will be posted by the tables.
Residential Halls Study Groups: There are free study groups that meet at the study tables in the
freshmen dorms, Jester and Kinsolving. More information is available at
http://cns.utexas.edu/community/resident-hall-study-groups

Private tutors: The Physics undergraduate adminstrator in RLM 5.116 can put you in touch with private
tutors. Rates and other arrangements are made directly between tutors and students.
Homework: Each homework assignment will have the same weight toward your final grade. Homework
is due at 11pm on its due dates. Late homework assignments will not be accepted. Solutions to
homework will be available on Quest after its due date.
Midterm exams: Midterm exams will NOT be held in the usual classroom, but in another room to be
announced. Midterm exams will be multiple choice and use Scantron sheets. You must bring your UT ID
and at least two #2 pencils to the midterms. Solutions to midterms will be available on Quest after all
tests have been graded.
Adding and Dropping the Course: See the UT Austin Academic Calendar,
https://registrar.utexas.edu/calendars/17-18. During the first four class days, students may add and
drop courses using the Registrar’s online service. During class days 5-12, students may drop courses
online but must get departmental permission to add the course. For this course, you should contact the
physics department. Some departments may not allow add/drops after the fourth class day. If you wish
to add a course after the twelfth class day, you must go to the Student Division of the Dean’s Office (1st
floor of WC Hogg) to provide justification for the proposed change. You must have written permission
and documentation of class attendance from the instructor and approval from the department.
Academic Q-drop: See the UT Austin Academic Calendar. If you want to drop this course after the 12th
class day and before the Q-drop deadline, you must get the forms from the Dean’s Office (WCH 1.106)
or your departmental advising center and ask the instructor to sign the drop form.
Nonacademic Q-drop: Students who have substantiated nonacademic reasons, as determined by the
Dean’s Office, may be able to drop a course. Students with significant nonacademic problems, such as
extended health difficulties or family emergencies, are encouraged to contact the Dean’s Office. The
course instructor cannot give permission for a nonacademic Q-drop.
One-time Drop: Once in his/her undergraduate career, a student who has completed at least two long
semesters at UTAustin can drop a class or all classes in a semester at any point until the last class day. A
student may drop a class only if he or she has an average grade of D+ or below in the class at the time of
the request and if there are no pending investigations of scholastic dishonesty for the course in
question. More information is available here: http://www.utexas.edu/faculty/council/2010-
2011/legislation/EPC_OTE.html
Quantitative Reasoning Flag: This course carries the Quantitative Reasoning flag. Quantitative
Reasoning courses are designed to equip you with skills that are necessary for understanding the types
of quantitative arguments you will regularly encounter in your adult and professional life. You should
therefore expect a substantial portion of your grade to come from your use of quantitative skills to
analyze real-world problems.

Safety in Emergency Situations: Occupants of buildings on The University of Texas at Austin campus are
required to evacuate buildings when a fire alarm is activated. Alarm activation or announcement
requires exiting and assembling outside. Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of each classroom and
building you may occupy. Remember that the nearest exit door may not be the one you used when
entering the building. Students requiring assistance in evacuation shall inform their instructor in writing
during the first week of class. In the event of an evacuation, follow the instruction of faculty or class
instructors. Do not re-enter a building unless given instructions by the following: Austin Fire
Department, The University of Texas at Austin Police Department, or Fire Prevention Services office. If
you have concerns about the behavior of a member of the campus community, you may call the
Behavior Concerns Advice Line (BCAL): 512-232-5050. Link to information regarding emergency
evacuation routes and emergency procedures can be found at: www.utexas.edu/emergency
Finding buildings at UT: For this course, you need to be able to find buildings for recitation sections,
office hours, midterms, and the final exam, as well as the classroom. There is an online map of campus
buildings: http://www.utexas.edu/maps/index.html
Please see the next page for the
course schedule.

Old exams are available on Canvas. These give you an idea of how my exams are constructed (a mix of
conceptual and computational problems) and show you what I think is an appropriate level of difficulty
for an exam. Your midterm exams will be about 30 questions long. Your final exam will be about 40
questions long.
How to do well in this class: You should expect to spend, at a minimum, three hours studying outside of
class for every hour you spend in lecture. Read the material to be covered in class before coming to
class, and a second time afterwards. Some iClicker questions will concern material the reading that has
not yet been covered in lecture. Review your lecture notes after each lecture. Make written notes of
things that you do not understand from the reading and lectures, and come talk with the instructor, the
TA, a LA, or a physics graduate student coach about the things you do not understand. Start working on
your homework as soon as possible. The homework assignments are difficult and they will take
substantial time to do. As soon as you have obtained an answer to a problem, submit it – don’t wait
until you have solved other problems. On Quest, you are allowed multiple tries for missed questions,
but less credit is possible after each wrong answer. This course moves rapidly, and students who fall
behind are often not able to catch up. Test your understanding by answering questions and working
problems from the textbook in addition to the assigned homework.
