Important Class Announcements:
Breaking news important to the class will be posted here. Consult this
spot often.
On Friday, January 30, I'm attended some sessions of a conference on
campus. We'll have class, but I won't hold my usual office hours from
10am-noon that day.
Your first assignment is here: Assignment 1. It assumes that we've
made some progress on slideset 1.
If you're curious, here's an exam from a previous semester: Sample
midterm
Here's a list of project topics from last Spring: Project Topics.
I have now created the groups for your class project. They were
assigned randomly. Here's a list: Groups.
Feel free to email me (Send me an email message), but please put
"CS361C" in the header. I'm teaching another class this semester and
this helps me to understand the context of your question or comment.

Course Description:
Information Assurance is dedicated to keeping information safe from
harm. This encompasses computer security, but also communications
security, operations security, and physical security. That's a lot to
study in one course. For example, NSA has an Information Assurance
Directorate tasked with: "detecting, reporting, and responding to cyber
threats; making encryption codes to securely pass information between
systems; and embedding IA measures directly into the emerging
Global Information Grid. It includes building secure audio and video
communications equipment, making tamper protection products, and
providing trusted microelectronics solutions. It entails testing the
security of customers' systems, providing OPSEC assistance, and
evaluating commercial software and hardware against nationally set
standards, to better meet our nation's IA needs."
Our approach will be to cover selected topics from this very broad area
of study with the goal of preparing the student to think critically about
security from a wholistic perspective, rather than a purely technical
perspective. Also, the topics covered will be those deemed necessary
for the InfoSec Certification. Topics may include:
1. Introduction to Information Assurance
2. Metrics for Information Assurance
3. Networking and Cryptography
4. Information Assurance Planning and Deployment
5. Vulnerabilities and Protection
6. Identity and Trust Technologies
7. Verification and Evaluation
8. Incident Response
9. Human Factors
10. Legal, Ethical, and Social Implications
Students are expected to read assigned materials prior to the class
meeting and to participate actively in the discussion. A significant
portion of your grade will be based on your engagement in the class.
Notice that CS students at UT have the option of completing a number

CS 361C, Spring 2015: Syllabus http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~byoung/cs361c/syllabus361c.html
of security-related courses and receiving a government-sanctioned
certification in security. See the following link for information: Infosec
Certification.
Prerequisites:
You are expected to have taken and passed the following courses (or
equivalent) with a grade of at least C-: Computer Science 311, 311H,
313H, or 313K; Computer Science 307, 314, 314H, 315, or 315H;
Computer Science 310, 310H, 429, or 429H; and Mathematics 408C,
408K, or 408N. If you don't have the prerequisites, be sure to clear it
with the CS department, or risk being dropped from the course.
Using Piazza:
We will be using Piazza for class discussion. The system is highly
catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from classmates, the
TAs, and myself. Rather than emailing questions to the teaching staff, I
encourage you to post your questions on Piazza. If you have any
problems or feedback for the developers, email team@piazza.com. Our
class page will be set up shortly and announced here. Return to top of
page.
Textbook and Slides:
There is no required text for the class this semester.
Handouts of all class slides will be made available over the course of
the semester via links below. Slides din PDF format. The PDF files can
be viewed with Acroread. If you print from Acroread, you can print 2 or
4 slides per page; I suggest that you do so to save paper.
Slide set 0: It's a Dangerous (Cyber) World (PDF)
Slide set 1: Intro to Information Assurance (PDF)
Return to top of page.
Readings and Assignments:
I will occasionally assign readings from papers over the course of the
semester. You are expected to have read the assigned material and
also to have read the course slides before class. There may be pop
quizzes on this material at any time.
There will be several projects assigned over the course of the

CS 361C, Spring 2015: Syllabus http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~byoung/cs361c/syllabus361c.html
semester. Each student should work on assignments individually unless
I explicitly say that teams are allowed. The projects generally will not
be programming projects, but will involve writing short reports on
various aspects of security. This is not a writing course and your
spelling and grammar skill will not be graded. Rather, the grade will
depend on the amount of thought and (possibly) research you put into
the assignment. However, you should strive to produce quality work
that is grammatically correct and formatted nicely.
Standing assignment: Read over the class slides before we discuss
them.
Assignment 1, due 2/6/15 at classtime
Semester project: In addition to the other assignments, teams of 5
students will become experts in some specialized security topic, write a
paper on that topic, and make a presentation to the class. A partial list
of possible topics will be offered. If a topic strikes your fancy, you can
claim it by sending me an email. All topics must be distinct. Since there
over 100 students in the class, it is infeasible for students to work
alone on this. However, the fact that you are working as teams of 5
means that your product must be a high quality team effort.
An alternative to a class presentation is to produce a high quality video
describing your work. It will be shown in class in lieu of your
presentation. An excellent example from a previous semester is here:
Drone Video
You will be provided very specific formatting instructions for the project
paper. In particular, it will be done using LaTeX and following a format
provided. This has two goals:
1. it eliminates the tendency to fudge the length of the paper by
padding;
2. it teaches you a very useful technical skill if you ever plan to
publish in a technical arena (or even if you don't).
Everything you need to know about LaTeX will be provided.
Quizzes:
Short in-class quizzes may be given at any time. These will cover
material covered in previous classes and check whether you are
keeping up with the reading. There will be no makeups for quizzes you
miss, but any single quiz is only a tiny proportion of your final grade.

CS 361C, Spring 2015: Syllabus http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~byoung/cs361c/syllabus361c.html
Tests:
There will be two major tests during the semester. Both tests will be
given during the regular class-time. The first will be March 11; the
second will be May 6. Here's a midterm exam from a previous
semester: Sample midterm. Your best study strategy is to review the
readings and class notes and ensure that you understand thoroughly
the topics we covered in class. Tests are open book / open notes.
The final test will be held in class the last week of classes. A sample
final test will be posted. There will be no final exam during the exam
period.
No laptops:
Students are asked not to have their laptops or other electronic
devices open during class. Copies of all slides will be provided. Please
just listen, participate, and absorb the material.
Grading policies:
Class attendance is required and will be checked on a majority of class
days. Excessive unexcused absences will result in a reduced grade. If
you don't plan to come to class regularly, don't register for this class.
Signing in for another student not present will be considered cheating
by both students.
Grades are averaged using the weighting below, with the following
proviso: You will not receive passing credit for the course if you have
unexcused absences for more than half of the scheduled class
meetings at which attendance is taken.
Also, this class largely consists of discussion. You must participate in
the discussions. If you are either too shy or too lazy to participate, it
will affect your grade negatively. Please discuss it with me if you have
issues that keep you from speaking up in class.

Attendance, Quizzes and Participation 10%
Paper and presentation 30%

Other Assignments 20%
Midterm Test 20%
Final Test 20%
Course grades are assigned on the scale: A = 90-100; B = 80-90; etc.,
except that I reserve the right to be more generous than this indicates.
That is, I may enlarge any of these ranges; I will not shrink any range.
How to Succeed in this Class:
You succeed in this class by participating fully. It may be possible to
coast through it, but you won't get a good grade.
1. Come to class regularly
2. Read the slides before class
3. Think carefully about the questions embedded in the slides
(usually in purple)
4. Do any assigned readings on time
5. Participate in the class discussions
6. Take enough time and care with the assignments
Scholastic Dishonesty:
Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated. See
http://www.cs.utexas.edu/academics/conduct for an excellent
summary of expectations of a student in a CS class.
All work must be the student's own effort (with the exception of
explicitly approved group effort on projects). No deviation from the
standards of scholastic honesty or professional integrity will be
tolerated. Scholastic dishonesty is a serious violation of UT policy; and
will likely result in an automatic F in the course and may result in
further penalties imposed by the department or by the university.
Don't do it. If you are caught, you will regret it. And if you're not
caught, you're still a cheater.

recent articles are near the top. You are encouraged to read these, but
they are not a required part of the course, unless I specifically require
you to read selected ones.
