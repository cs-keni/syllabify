Overview
Biology 349 is a one-semester course covering the principles underlying animal development,
focusing on embryonic development. The main objectives of this course are to:
• Describe the overall framework and structural features of embryonic development.
• Explore some of the experimental paradigms and model systems most widely used in
the analysis of biological development.
• Enable you to read papers, to think critically about the primary data underlying
experiments and to analyze and interpret the results. You should be able to propose
experiments based on techniques we have learned that allow you to answer scientific
questions.
• Examine the cellular and molecular mechanisms that allow the embryonic cells to
acquire their unique developmental instructions, and the way in which those
instructions determine the subset of genes that a cell will express.
In this course I will discuss developmental concepts, making use of examples from whichever
experimental system(s) have proven most useful for studying each step in the process. We will
therefore consider embryonic development in a diverse array of species, including some vertebrate
animals (e.g. frog, mouse, bird, fish) and some invertebrate animals (e.g. fruitfly, sea urchin,
nematode).
I am a faculty member in the Section of Molecular Cellular & Developmental Biology and a member of
the Institute for Cellular and Molecular Biology. My research laboratory focuses directly on
understanding how limbs develop (for more information see http://www.sbs.utexas.edu/vokes_lab/).
As a developmental biologist, I love this material, and I want you to learn it and to enjoy learning it. If
you have suggestions or questions, or if you want more information on a specific topic that interests

you, or if you are struggling with the material, or even if you just want to understand it better, then
come talk to me.
Course Organization
BIO349 will consist of three 50 minutes lectures per week accompanied by readings (see below) from
“Developmental Biology”, S.F. Gilbert, 9th edition. You are encouraged to raise your hand at any time
with questions and comments to ensure that you understand the material. In the interest of covering
all the ground, I may on occasion defer answering more specific questions until after class or in office
hours. I will post preliminary Power point images on the Blackboard web site before the lecture. The
images actually used in the lecture will be posted after the lecture. There will be occasional additional
handouts that will be posted on Blackboard and distributed in class. There are likely to be changes in
reading assignments during the course, and these will be posted on Blackboard.
The lectures are supplemented by Discussion Sections in which the teaching assistant will answer
questions and provide help with study questions. Attendance is optional. There are three BIO349
Discussion Sections scheduled per week (see pg. 1), and you may attend any or all of them.
Feedback is an important part of any kind of learning. Without feedback on how well you understand
the material, it is more difficult for you to make significant progress. During this course you will give
me feedback on your learning in informal and formal ways, such as questions, suggestions, and
exams. I want you to let me know when something we discuss is not clear. This kind of
communication will enable me to provide additional information when needed or to explain a concept
in different terms.
Prerequisites
To enroll, students must have received a grade of "C" or better in BIO325 or 325H (Genetics).
Upper-division courses in cell and molecular biology are advantageous but not required. Though not
a formal pre-requisite, a solid understanding of cell and molecular biology is essential for successful
completion of this course. Upper division courses in cell and molecular biology are particularly useful.
Examinations
There will be four scheduled in-semester examinations and a final exam (comprehensive), worth
100 points apiece. Each in-semester exam will specifically cover the material presented since the last
exam, although the later three mid-term examinations will also assume knowledge of general topics
that have been emphasized throughout the course. Exams will consist of both multiple-choice and
short answer/problem/short essay questions and will follow an identical format except for Exam #4
which will have a higher percentage of multiple choice questions. The final grade will be determined
by adding your four best exam scores (this includes the final). If you have taken all four exams during
the semester and are happy with your grade, you do not need to take the final exam.
Any material covered in class, in the posted notes, or in the readings accompanying the lectures may
be examined. Please note that the lecture handouts on Blackboard will not include additional material
mentioned in class or presented on the board during lectures. Students who miss class are
responsible for obtaining these notes from one of their classmates.
Please bring to the exams both a pencil (for multiple choice bubble sheets) and a pen (for essays), as
well as your photo ID. All written sections must be answered in pen. If you accidentally write in
pencil, your exam will still be graded but it will not be returned to you. You will be free to look at it
during TA office hours but it cannot leave the office. Do not bring a calculator, take out cell phones,
your textbook or your notebooks during the exams. It is your responsibility to arrive at the exam on
time. Students who arrive late will not be given additional time.

Failing to take a scheduled examination will result in a score of 0 unless there is documented
evidence of circumstances appropriate to an absence and beyond your control. Acceptable reasons
for absence from an exam include:
• Illness - you should have a physician's note indicating that you were not in physical condition to
take the exam at the scheduled time. A note from a family member is insufficient.
• Death or grave illness in your immediate family.
• Significant scheduling conflicts such as medical/grad school interviews or athletic participation in
NCAA sporting events. Voluntary activities such as running in a marathon do not excuse you from
an exam.
This documentation, which is generally issued by the Dean’s office, must be presented within one
week of the missed exam. In the event of a missed exam for which appropriate documentation of
absence has been provided, the final grade will be the sum of the other 4 exams. The only
circumstance for which make-up exams will be given is one in which two exams have been missed,
both documented, and for acceptable reasons beyond your reasonable control (see above). Under
those circumstances, I will administer a make-up exam (worth 100 pts, 25% of the grade). In the
event that a student requires a make-up exam to be administered, the form of the exam (written
versus oral, or a combination of the two) will be at the discretion of Dr. Vokes.
Grading
This course will use plus/minus grading. Final letter grades will be determined by the cumulative
points on your four best exams, and will be based on the following grade scale.
Grades
A = 360 pts or higher (90+%)
A-= 340-359 (85-89.75%)
B+= 320-339 (80-84.75%)
B = 300-319 pts (75-79.75%)
B-= 280-299 (70-74.75%)
C+=268-279 (67-69.75%)
C = 252-267 pts (63-66.75%)
C-=240-251 (60-62.75%)
D+=228-239 (57-59.75%)
D = 212-227 pts (53-56.75%)
D-=200-211 (50-52.75%)
F = 199 pts or fewer (<50%)
In the event that the overall class average for all exams totals less than 280 (70%) for students
having taken all five exams, after excluding grades below 50% I will raise all students point totals
equivalently by the number of points that will bring the average to 280 (70%).
Please note that following the assignment of a final grade, under no circumstances will I
negotiate a grade assignment with a student whose point total falls (even closely) below a
cutoff. i.e., if you intend to achieve an A in this class, your total points at the end of the course
must be 360 or higher. In order to achieve a B, your cumulative points total will need to be 300
or higher.
We make every attempt to grade all students by fair and uniform criteria. Exams will not be regraded
except for cases in which there was a clear mistake in the original grading or in the addition of points.

Regrade requests must be submitted to the me within 2 weeks of the date when the exam was
handed back to the class. If you pick up your graded exam later than 2 weeks after the date at which
the exam was returned in class, you will not be eligible for a regrade. In the event that a regrade is
requested, the exam must be accompanied by a separate sheet of paper giving the number of the
question(s) to be regraded, and a written explanation as to why the original answer deserved more
points than were awarded. For multiple part questions, the entire question will be regraded. The
regrade request should not be written on the exam itself, nor should any other alterations have been
made. The instructor will reserve the right to regrade the entire exam in the event of a regrade
request.
Academic dishonesty
We adhere to the core principles of the university honor code. Academic dishonesty of any sort will
not be tolerated in my class. I will prosecute - to the fullest extent allowed by the university - anyone
who is caught cheating in my class. With particular relevance to this course, this will include anyone
who is caught cheating on an exam or who is caught altering a graded exam in an attempt to obtain
additional credit. To protect against dishonest practices, we may photocopy selected portions of all
graded exams before they are returned to the class. Please review the University’s policy on
academic dishonesty at http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acadint.php.
Classroom etiquette
Please avoid any behavior that could disrupt the learning environment of others. Please turn off your
cell phones (or set them to vibrate) when you are at class. Students are expected to follow the
“Standards of Conduct” outlined by the University: http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/conduct.php.
Graduate student enrollment
BIO349 is intended as an upper-division undergraduate course, but may also be appropriate for
graduate students who have not had formal instruction in this area. Graduate students will take the
same exams as undergraduates, and be graded similarly. For graduate students the exam grades
will account for 75% of the final grade. A term paper, the topic of which will be discussed with Dr.
Vokes, will account for 25% of the final grade. Graduate students interested in taking this course
should speak to Dr. Vokes about how to register appropriately for the course.
Religious observances
I have attempted to schedule the exams to avoid conflicts with those religious holy days of which I am
aware. If you have a conflict with a religious holy day and would like accommodation, you must bring
it to my attention during the first two weeks of class.
Special needs
The policy of UT Austin is to provide appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities. To
receive such accommodations, students must present me with a letter prepared by the Division of
Diversity and Community Engagement, Services for Students with Disabilities (471-6259). This letter
must be given to Dr. Vokes at least one week prior to the first exam, or during the first week of
classes if accommodations are required for the lectures.

Suggestions on how to succeed in BIO349
• This is an upper division college science course, and you are not likely to get a good grade if you
do not attend lectures.
• Final letter grades will be determined solely by exam scores. There will be no opportunities for
'extra-credit' ... it will not be possible to make up for poor exam performance after the fact. If you
find that there are things that you do not understand, ask questions in class, go to discussion
sections and ask questions, go to office hours and ask questions, or post the question on the
Discussion Board section of Blackboard (Dr. Vokes will check this daily).
• Everyone learns differently, and you should try to find a learning/studying strategy that works for
you. My general advice is that you should make an effort to take good notes in class, then study
for exams by first going back over the lecture notes (the notes you take in class and the ones I
post) and reviewing the main topics from each lecture. Pay special attention to the study questions
that are provided each week. Rather than simply memorizing the answers, you need to
understand the underlying concepts and how to apply them to new scenarios. If concepts aren’t
clear, go to the discussion sections and ask questions or go to the office hours and ask
questions.
• It is my expectation that you not only learn important facts but that you can use that knowledge to
solve questions pertaining to developmental biology. Therefore, on your exams you will be asked
to apply the knowledge that you’ve gained in the lectures.
