comPutinG your Grade
before final: a =[ (20*(Quiz Average) + ..6*(Exam Average)]/.8
after final: b = .8*a+ .2*Final
Your average determines your grade: no special deals, no retakes, no curves. Thus, you're able to
compute how you're doing at any time in the course.
reGrades
From our standpoint, a regrade is to correct errors. You should ask for a regrade to correct things that
you feel we missed, or graded unfairly.
I will never lower your grade.
the rules
1) Mark the questions you want me to look at, and give the exam to the TA or me.
2) Don't ask 'look at everything I missed to give me extra points'
3) Ask for the regrade within about a four days after you get it back.
4) I'll bring the regraded paper to class with me, usually the next class day

you are assigned. If you switch sections, your material will not be graded. Exceptions can be granted
by your TA (eg, I work then; I overslept...).

a note about studyinG
I taught this course Spring 2012. I did a really mean thing on exam three: I put on it a problem I had
worked in class and told everyone was important. About 80% of the class had no idea how to even
start the problem.
I did a really mean thing on the final: it was only two questions long, and I put on it two problems I
had worked in class. About 80% of the class had no idea how to even start the problems.
Is there a point to this story? You decide.
