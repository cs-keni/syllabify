SYLLABUS: PHL 323K ISSUES IN METAPHYSICS
Professor Adam Pautz
Office: WAG 408A
Office Hours: Friday, 10-12.
Email: apautz@mail.utexas.edu
DESCRIPTION
We will examine some main issues in metaphysics: personal identity, free will, God, and
color.
FLAG
This course carries the Writing Flag (Wr). Writing Flag courses are designed to give
students experience with writing in an academic discipline. In this class, you can expect to
write regularly during the semester, complete substantial writing projects, and receive
feedback from your instructor to help you improve your writing. You will also have the
opportunity to revise one or more assignments, and you may be asked to read and discuss
your peers’ work. You should therefore expect a substantial portion of your grade to
come from your written work. Writing Flag classes meet the Core Communications
objectives of Critical Thinking, Communication, Teamwork, and Personal Responsibility,
established by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board.
REQUIREMENTS
The objective is to understand the main issues, the main arguments, and to hone general
thinking and writing skills.
(1) Class participation 5%
In order to get full credit here, you must come to class, and you must ask several
questions, or make several comments, in class during the course of the semester.
(Incidentally, to help foster class discussion, I will often divide you into small groups.)
(2) Questions or comments about readings 5%
There will be 24 reading assignments (A1-A24 below). I require that, after you finish each
reading, you email me two short questions or comments on that reading. Generally, I
expect you to email me these around the time I assign the reading, but I will also accept
late comments. (So if I say “for our next meeting read assignments X and Y”, then I prefer
that you to send me two questions or comments on each of X and Y prior to that
meeting.) This will help me and you. You will be graded on this pass-fail: if (and only if)
by the last class period (Thursday, December 4) you turn in two questions or comments
on each reading (A1-A24), you pass (5 points), otherwise you fail (0 points). Send these
to my gmail (non-Utexas account): adam.pautz@gmail.com. It is your responsibility to
keep track of your assignment comments. You can put assignment numbers in your title,
and you can keep your emails to me in your outbox.
(3) Midterm Short Essay 20%
10-15 page essay on personal identity. Due by Friday, October 24. Email it to me in pdf
format. I will write comments to help you improve your writing. I ask that you keep these
comments in mind in writing your final paper. I will send you a detailed assignment.

(4) Rough Draft of Final Paper: 10%.
Due Date: Tuesday, November 25 (about week prior to our last class day).
15-20 pages. Topic: one of the theories discussed in class after personal identity (a
detailed assignment will be supplied in class). The rough draft will be graded credit/no
credit (10% or 0%). On the due date, I will have you bring a hard-copy of your rough
draft to class, exchange it with a paper partner. Each will write comments on the other’s
paper. To get credit for your rough draft, you must turn in your rough draft, with your
paper partner’s comments on it, with your final draft. Also, your rough draft must be 15-
20 pages, and must be at least readable.
(5) Final Draft of Second Paper: 60%.
Due Date: Thursday, December 11 (a week after our last class day; two weeks after rough
draft due).
This paper must be a significantly revised version of your rough draft. (I will not accept it,
if it is identical with your rough draft.)
(6) Late policy. I will not accept lateness (zero-credit) unless you have a documented
excuse, such as illness, death in the family, etc.
(7) Grading
I do not use ‘+’ or ‘-‘.
