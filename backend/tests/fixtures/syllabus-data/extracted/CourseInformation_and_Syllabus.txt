Homework: Consists mostly of problems from Adam’s book. They are generally due a week after the
set of lectures covering the relevant content. Homeworks will be submitted in via Gradescope. After
uploading your homework file, please be sure to use the Select Pages option to assign individual
pages of your solution to the corresponding problem number. Doing so will help the TA and grader
to spend more time looking at the content of your everyone’s work and less time looking for the pages

where the answers are located. If you have an issue with how your homework was graded, please
contact the TA first. If the TA cannot resolve the issue, then you may contact the instructor. Late
homework is 10% off when turned in one day late, 20% off when two days late, and zero thereafter.
Homework will not be accepted more than two days late so that solutions can be posted in a timely
manner.

Grading:

2. Homework problem assignments. 24% total
3. In-class group problems. 10% total
4. Final exam (in-person). 22% total
My goal is to create an environment where students can collaborate and support one another in
mastering the course material. I want to avoid any perception that grades are competitive, as this can
hinder cooperation. Therefore, this class will not be graded on a curve. While this might initially
seem intimidating, please know that partial credit will be generously awarded on homework and exams,
and there will be no "minus" letter grades in this class. For reference, the average letter grade in this
class last year was a B. Below is the grading rubric (modified from the one shown on the official UT
page [here]) that outlines how weighted numeric grades will be converted to letter grades in this class:
Scholastic Dishonesty:
UT policy will be followed. This is not intended to tell you that it won't be tolerated (it won't), but to tell
you what is permissible and what is not.
Homework: conferring with others is encouraged, but what you submit must be your own work (not
copied). For the project, one common version is submitted. What you submit must be the team's own
work, programs, results, etc., or it must be referenced properly. If it's not referenced, and it's not yours,

then it is plagiarism. I do encourage consulting all sources that you can (including your uncle at IBM)
so long as those sources are acknowledged. Be careful to cite web sources completely as well.
Exams: Note sheets and programmable calculators are allowed for the exams. Any exchange of
information (one-way or two-way) outside of you, your note sheet, and your calculator during the exam
is obviously NOT OK. Prior knowledge of exam questions is also NOT OK.
