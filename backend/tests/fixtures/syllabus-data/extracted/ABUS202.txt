Course Objectives
This course is designed to help executive students understand the foundations of strategy, in terms of
antecedents, formulations, and effects of firm strategies. Through readings, lectures, case analyses,
discussions and assignments, students will familiarize with major theories, concepts, analytical tools and
frameworks of strategic management. By the end of the course, students should have learnt to: (i) analyze
complex business situations and accordingly formulate strategies to manage them, (ii) be aware of issues
that may arise during the implementation of strategies, (iii) understand possible effects of implementing
particular strategies, and (iv) understand why some firms may outperform others.
This course will include analyses of industries, identification of opportunities and threats in the firm’s
environment, and understanding of a firm’s core competence and its sustainability. It also covers specific
topics such as managing value creation and appropriation along the vertical chain, horizontal expansions
within and across industries, acquisitions, and process of strategy implementation.
Leadership and this Course
The Texas Executive MBA program is designed to develop influential business leaders. The program has
identified four fundamental and broad pillars of leadership: knowledge and understanding,
communication and collaboration, responsibility and integrity, and a worldview of business and society.
In this course, you will enhance your knowledge and understanding of strategy formulation. Through
class discussion, small-group break-outs, and group-based case analyses, you will enhance your
communication and collaboration skills. You will learn how rigorous and responsible strategy formulation
enhance managers’ ability to lead their organizations effectively and with integrity. Cases and examples
will touch on international companies and issues involving stakeholders outside of the firm, affording you
a global and broad perspective and worldview on strategy.

Course Requirements and Grading
Grading will be based on class participation, group project presentation, and a final examination. These
four components are weighted as follows:
1. Class Participation (Individual) 25%
2. Final Exam / Quiz 25%
3. Group Project Presentation 50%
The distribution of grades will follow the core guidelines and be roughly as follows: 25% A, 20% A-, 15%
B+, 35% B, 5% B- or below.
Class Participation
Students’ participations in class constitute a significant portion of value-add in this course. Each student’s
comments and questions help sharpen thoughts and enhance learning, of not just the student himself/
herself but also of others in class. Hence, students are expected to participate actively in class in a
meaningful way. At the beginning of the semester, not every student will be comfortable with participating
in class. However, this discomfort will be eroded with practice. Do not be shy!
Meaningful participation does not correspond to monopolizing ‘airtime’. One sharp question or comment
is more valuable than multiple non-thoughtful and distracting ones. Students are expected to put in their
best effort to help the instructor create a constructive, dynamic, progressive, and fun learning
environment for the class with thoughtful and meaningful participations.
Participation will be assessed for each student in each class. The instructor will be discerning when
assessing the quality of participation. Specifically, the instructor will assess students’ comments and
questions based on, but not limited to, the following:
◼ Are they relevant to the discussion and well thought out?
◼ Do they help advance the discussion in constructive ways?
◼ Do they provide new insights that facilitate deeper understanding of the case?
◼ Are they well-backed by facts and data from the case?
◼ Do they advance the class discussions by building on earlier points discussed?
◼ Do they demonstrate the student’s understanding and incorporation of others’ points brought up
earlier?
◼ Do they constructively challenge the class and the instructor to think further about the case?

Final Exam / Quiz:
The final exam / quiz will take place over a weekend towards the end of the semester, the exact dates to
be determined. I will announce the exact weekend dates ASAP. It is a ‘take-home’, opened book exam /
quiz that you will download from Canvas and submit on Canvas when you are done. It will examine
students’ knowledge of materials covered in the entire course. In addition, it will assess students’ ability
to apply that knowledge to the diagnosis of strategic issues and the development of specific
recommendations. Please note: students have to submit the exam by the end of the scheduled time on
that weekend; no late submissions allowed. To be fair to all students, there will be no other make-up
exams or make-up assignments. Failure to take the final exam will result in an exam score of zero.
Guidelines For Group Project Presentation
1. The group project is to be conducted in your study groups. The project involves the strategic
analysis of, and problem-solving for, a company, using theories, concepts, and techniques we will learn
in class. It is meant to be an active application of the more analytical-based materials covered in class.
The presentations are scheduled to take place on 29 Apr 2022 during class time. No submission of written
reports required.
2. Pick a company. Analyze its external environment and internal strengths /weakness to
identify one or a few key strategic problems that it faces, and propose a strategy solution to
address these problems. Your identified problem and proposed solution must be big, major issues that
are strategic in nature that top management of the company faces, not small operational issues. Some
examples include (but not limited to): changing technologies in the environment resulting in a need to
change business model, losing cost-competitiveness to rivals leading to a need to expand internationally
or vertical integration, major shifts in nature of consumer demand leading to a need to radically change
the company’s product or services, changing industry dynamics leading to current organization of the
company being inadequate / inefficient, etc.
3. The key part of this project lies in the problem identification. Make sure the problem you identified
is insightful. Once you identify the key problem in an insightful and specific manner, the strategy solution
should obviously follow. If the key problem you identified for the firm is something so obvious that any
layman on the streets can tell you the same thing without much analysis, then you have probably not yet
identified the correct key problem.
4. Please make sure the identification of the strategic problem and proposing of solution are based
on detailed and systematic analyses using at least one (or more if necessary) frameworks or concepts
covered in class during the semester. Your identified problem and solution must clearly be based on and
logically follow from your analyses of the company and its environment using at least one framework or
concept covered in class. (The case discussions in class are meant to illustrate how to do this). In your
presentation, you have to make this very clear. Baseless and seemingly-random problems or solutions
that are not clearly stemming from such analyses, or that arise from nowhere in particular, will be
penalized.
5. The analyses need to be backed by rich and relevant data / facts / details about the company and
its environment. You will have to research and find these details yourself. You may find it easier from a
data availability point of view to work with public companies. However, you are free to pick privately-held
companies to analyze if you have access to data about them. Please note: companies that are featured
in the course as cases cannot be used for the group project.
6. (Optional) You may want to begin your presentation with a brief introduction / summary of the key
problem your identified for your company, the main logic and reasons for this problem and your proposed
3

Faculty name Course—Semester and Year page 4
solution. Be brief and focused; this would give your audience the “big picture” and guide them in terms of
where you are going with the presentation.
7. In your presentation, please do not simply ‘dump’ information. You need to use at least one
framework and / or concept covered in class, systematically analyze the data / facts / details you found,
and interpret and present them in an organized way. It is your responsibility (not mine) to interpret
information you present into strategic analyses. I will not analyze these details or infer the strategic issues
from them for you. Data / facts / details thrown into the presentation without interpretation will simply be
disregarded.
8. When using frameworks or concepts covered in class, please do not mindlessly go through and
superficially discuss every single aspect of the frameworks or concepts. Only include relevant
components of the frameworks and concepts. Remember that this is an exercise at applying the
frameworks and concepts; use only relevant parts of them.
9. As far as possible, reference your data sources during the presentation.

Classroom Do’s and Don’ts
The highest professional standards are expected of all members of the McCombs community. The
collective class reputation and the value of the Texas MBA experience hinges on this. Please note the
following:
◼ Please make sure you cover the readings and analyze the cases before coming to class. You will
likely not learn much (or anything) if you attend a case-based class without reading the case
before.
◼ Always display your name tag in front of you during in-person class. For Zoom session, please
make sure your name is correctly displayed online.
◼ Arrive on time (either in person or online). On time arrival ensures that classes are able to start
and finish at the scheduled time. On time arrival shows respect for both fellow students and faculty
and it enhances learning by reducing avoidable distractions.
◼ You are expected to attend every class (either in person or online).
◼ If you miss class, you are responsible for (i) informing me beforehand, (ii) obtaining from your
classmates any notes, handouts, additional reading materials, assignment changes, and
additional discussions during class.
◼ Each student is responsible for any assignment changes that arise throughout the semester. This
includes understanding that if one class session runs long, we will conclude that discussion in the
following class and then begin our discussion of the next case. I will not post such changes on
Canvas, so you are responsible for knowing where we are in the course.
◼ You are strongly encouraged to form study groups and brain-storm about cases and reading
assignments.
◼ Learning by doing is a critical feature of this course. You will deprive yourself and others of that
opportunity if you discuss cases with students who have taken this class in the past or in another
section during the current semester. Therefore, it is an honor code violation to send or receive
any communications about what happened in another section prior to our discussion of a
particular case. No talking (verbal, electronic or otherwise) or sharing notes across sections until
after a focal case is finished in all sections.
◼ Per Management Department policy, all cell phones must be turned off.
◼ The University of Texas at Austin provides upon request appropriate academic accommodations
for qualified students with disabilities. For more information, contact the Office of the Dean of
Students at 471-6259, 471-6441 TTY.
◼ All students must have access to Canvas and have their e-mail properly registered there.
◼ You are to respect the views and opinions of your classmates. Disagreement and debate are
encouraged. Intolerance for the views of others is unacceptable

Academic Dishonesty
I have no tolerance for acts of academic dishonesty. Such acts damage the reputation of the school and the degree
and demean the honest efforts of the majority of students. The minimum penalty for an act of academic dishonesty
will be a zero for that assignment or exam.
The responsibilities for both students and faculty with regard to the Honor System are described on the final pages
of this syllabus. As the instructor for this course, I agree to observe all the faculty responsibilities described therein.
As a Texas MBA student, you agree to observe all of the student responsibilities of the Honor Code. If the application
of the Honor System to this class and its assignments is unclear in any way, it is your responsibility to ask me for
clarification.
Honor Code Purpose
Academic honor, trust and integrity are fundamental to The University of Texas at Austin McCombs School of
Business community. They contribute directly to the quality of your education and reach far beyond the campus to
your overall standing within the business community. The University of Texas at Austin McCombs School of
Business Honor System promotes academic honor, trust and integrity throughout the Graduate School of Business.
The Honor System relies upon The University of Texas Student Standards of Conduct (Chapter 11 of the
Institutional Rules on Student Service and Activities) for enforcement, but promotes ideals that are higher than
merely enforceable standards. Every student is responsible for understanding and abiding by the provisions of the
Honor System and the University of Texas Student Standards of Conduct. The University expects all students to
obey the law, show respect for other members of the university community, perform contractual obligations,
maintain absolute integrity and the highest standard of individual honor in scholastic work, and observe the highest
standards of conduct. Ignorance of the Honor System or The University of Texas Student Standards of Conduct is
not an acceptable excuse for violations under any circumstances.
The effectiveness of the Honor System results solely from the wholehearted and uncompromising support of each
member of the McCombs School of Business community. Each member must abide by the Honor System and must
be intolerant of any violations. The system is only as effective as you make it.
Faculty Involvement in the Honor System
The University of Texas at Austin McCombs School of Business Faculty's commitment to the Honor System is
critical to its success. It is imperative that faculty make their expectations clear to all students. They must also
respond to accusations of cheating or other misconduct by students in a timely, discrete and fair manner. We urge
faculty members to promote awareness of the importance of integrity through in-class discussions and assignments
throughout the semester.
Expectations Under the Honor System Standards
If a student is uncertain about the standards of conduct in a particular setting, he or she should ask the relevant
faculty member for clarification to ensure his or her conduct falls within the expected scope of honor, trust and
integrity as promoted by the Honor System. This applies to all tests, papers and group and individual work.
Questions about appropriate behavior during the job search should be addressed to a professional member of the
Career Management Office. Below are some of the specific examples of violations of the Honor System.
Lying
Lying is any deliberate attempt to deceive another by stating an untruth, or by any direct form of communication to
include the telling of a partial truth. Lying includes the use or omission of any information with the intent to deceive
or mislead. Examples of lying include, but are not limited to, providing a false excuse for why a test was missed or
presenting false information to a recruiter.
Stealing
Stealing is wrongfully taking, obtaining, withholding, defacing or destroying any person's money, personal property,
article or service, under any circumstances. Examples of stealing include, but are not limited to, removing course
material from the library or hiding it from others, removing material from another person's mail folder, securing for
9

Faculty name Course—Semester and Year page 10
one's self unattended items such as calculators, books, book bags or other personal property. Another form of
stealing is the duplication of copyrighted material beyond the reasonable bounds of "fair use." Defacing (e.g.,
"marking up" or highlighting) library books is also considered stealing, because, through a willful act, the value of
another's property is decreased. (See the appendix for a detailed explanation of "fair use.")
Cheating
Cheating is wrongfully and unfairly acting out of self-interest for personal gain by seeking or accepting an
unauthorized advantage over one's peers. Examples include, but are not limited to, obtaining questions or answers
to tests or quizzes, and getting assistance on case write-ups or other projects beyond what is authorized by the
assigning instructor. It is also cheating to accept the benefit(s) of another person's theft(s) even if not actively sought.
For instance, if one continues to be attentive to an overhead conversation about a test or case write-up even if initial
exposure to such information was accidental and beyond the control of the student in question, one is also cheating.
If a student overhears a conversation or any information that any faculty member might reasonably wish to withhold
from the student, the student should inform the faculty member(s) of the information and circumstance under which
it was overheard.
Actions Required for Responding to Suspected and Known Violations
As stated, everyone must abide by the Honor System and be intolerant of violations. If you suspect a violation has
occurred, you should first speak to the suspected violator in an attempt to determine if an infraction has taken place.
If, after doing so, you still believe that a violation has occurred, you must tell the suspected violator that he or she
must report himself or herself to the course professor or Associate Dean of the McCombs School of Business. If
the individual fails to report himself or herself within 48 hours, it then becomes your obligation to report the infraction
to the course professor or the Associate Dean of the McCombs School of Business. Remember that although you
are not required by regulation to take any action, our Honor System is only as effective as you make it. If you remain
silent when you suspect or know of a violation, you are approving of such dishonorable conduct as the community
standard. You are thereby precipitating a repetition of such violations.
The Honor Pledge
The University of Texas at Austin McCombs School of Business requires each enrolled student to adopt the Honor
System. The Honor Pledge best describes the conduct promoted by the Honor System. It is as follows:
"I affirm that I belong to the honorable community of The University of Texas at Austin Graduate School of Business.
I will not lie, cheat or steal, nor will I tolerate those who do."
"I pledge my full support to the Honor System. I agree to be bound at all times by the Honor System and understand
that any violation may result in my dismissal from the McCombs School of Business."
The following pages provide specific guidance about the Standard of Academic Integrity at the University of Texas
at Austin. Please read it carefully and feel free to ask me any questions you might have.
Excerpts from the University of Texas at Austin Office of the Dean of Students website
(http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acint_student.php)
The Standard of Academic Integrity
A fundamental principle for any educational institution, academic integrity is highly valued and seriously regarded
at The University of Texas at Austin, as emphasized in the standards of conduct. More specifically, you and other
students are expected to "maintain absolute integrity and a high standard of individual honor in scholastic work"
undertaken at the University (Sec. 11-801, Institutional Rules on Student Services and Activities). This is a very
basic expectation that is further reinforced by the University's Honor Code. At a minimum, you should complete any
assignments, exams, and other scholastic endeavors with the utmost honesty, which requires you to:
• acknowledge the contributions of other sources to your scholastic efforts;
• complete your assignments independently unless expressly authorized to seek or obtain assistance in
preparing them;
• follow instructions for assignments and exams, and observe the standards of your academic discipline; and
10

Faculty name Course—Semester and Year page 11
• avoid engaging in any form of academic dishonesty on behalf of yourself or another student.
For the official policies on academic integrity and scholastic dishonesty, please refer to Chapter 11 of the
Institutional Rules on Student Services and Activities.
What is Scholastic Dishonesty?
In promoting a high standard of academic integrity, the University broadly defines scholastic dishonesty—basically,
all conduct that violates this standard, including any act designed to give an unfair or undeserved academic
advantage, such as:
• Cheating
• Plagiarism
• Unauthorized Collaboration
• Collusion
• Falsifying Academic Records
• Misrepresenting Facts (e.g., providing false information to postpone an exam, obtain an extended deadline
for an assignment, or even gain an unearned financial benefit)
• Any other acts (or attempted acts) that violate the basic standard of academic integrity (e.g., multiple
submissions—submitting essentially the same written assignment for two courses without authorization to do so)
Several types of scholastic dishonesty—unauthorized collaboration, plagiarism, and multiple submissions—are
discussed in more detail on this Web site to correct common misperceptions about these particular offenses and
suggest ways to avoid committing them.
For the University's official definition of scholastic dishonesty, see Section 11-802, Institutional Rules on Student
Services and Activities.
Unauthorized Collaboration
If you work with another person on an assignment for credit without the instructor's permission to do so, you are
engaging in unauthorized collaboration.
• This common form of academic dishonesty can occur with all types of scholastic work—papers, homework,
tests (take-home or in-class), lab reports, computer programming projects, or any other assignments to be
submitted for credit.
• For the University's official definitions of unauthorized collaboration and the related offense of collusion,
see Sections 11-802(c)(6) & 11-802(e), Institutional Rules on Student Services and Activities.
Some students mistakenly assume that they can work together on an assignment as long as the instructor has not
expressly prohibited collaborative efforts.
• Actually, students are expected to complete assignments independently unless the course instructor
indicates otherwise. So working together on assignments is not permitted unless the instructor specifically approves
of any such collaboration.
Unfortunately, students who engage in unauthorized collaboration tend to justify doing so through various
rationalizations. For example, some argue that they contributed to the work, and others maintain that working
together on an assignment "helped them learn better."
• The instructor—not the student—determines the purpose of a particular assignment and the acceptable
method for completing it. Unless working together on an assignment has been specifically authorized, always
assume it is not allowed.
• Many educators do value group assignments and other collaborative efforts, recognizing their potential for
developing and enhancing specific learning skills. And course requirements in some classes do consist primarily of
group assignments. But the expectation of individual work is the prevailing norm in many classes, consistent with
the presumption of original work that remains a fundamental tenet of scholarship in the American educational
system.
Some students incorrectly assume that the degree of any permissible collaboration is basically the same for all
classes.
• The extent of any permissible collaboration can vary widely from one class to the next, even from one
project to the next within the same class.
• Be sure to distinguish between collaboration that is authorized for a particular assignment and unauthorized
collaboration that is undertaken for the sake of expedience or convenience to benefit you and/or another student.
By failing to make this key distinction, you are much more likely to engage in unauthorized collaboration. To avoid
any such outcome, always seek clarification from the instructor.
11

Faculty name Course—Semester and Year page 12
Unauthorized collaboration can also occur in conjunction with group projects.
• How so? If the degree or type of collaboration exceeds the parameters expressly approved by the instructor.
An instructor may allow (or even expect) students to work together on one stage of a group project but require
independent work on other phases. Any such distinctions should be strictly observed.
Providing another student unauthorized assistance on an assignment is also a violation, even without the prospect
of benefiting yourself.
• If an instructor did not authorize students to work together on a particular assignment and you help a student
complete that assignment, you are providing unauthorized assistance and, in effect, facilitating an act of academic
dishonesty. Equally important, you can be held accountable for doing so.
• For similar reasons, you should not allow another student access to your drafted or completed assignments
unless the instructor has permitted those materials to be shared in that manner.
Plagiarism
Plagiarism is another serious violation of academic integrity. In simplest terms, this occurs if you represent as your
own work any material that was obtained from another source, regardless how or where you acquired it.
• Plagiarism can occur with all types of media—scholarly or non-academic, published or unpublished—
written publications, Internet sources, oral presentations, illustrations, computer code, scientific data or analyses,
music, art, and other forms of expression. (See Section 11-802(d) of the Institutional Rules on Student Services
and Activities for the University's official definition of plagiarism.)
• Borrowed material from written works can include entire papers, one or more paragraphs, single phrases,
or any other excerpts from a variety of sources such as books, journal articles, magazines, downloaded Internet
documents, purchased papers from commercial writing services, papers obtained from other students (including
homework assignments), etc.
• As a general rule, the use of any borrowed material results in plagiarism if the original source is not properly
acknowledged. So you can be held accountable for plagiarizing material in either a final submission of an
assignment or a draft that is being submitted to an instructor for review, comments, and/or approval.
Using verbatim material (e.g., exact words) without proper attribution (or credit) constitutes the most blatant form of
plagiarism. However, other types of material can be plagiarized as well, such as ideas drawn from an original source
or even its structure (e.g., sentence construction or line of argument).
• Improper or insufficient paraphrasing often accounts for this type of plagiarism. (See additional information
on paraphrasing.)
Plagiarism can be committed intentionally or unintentionally.
• Strictly speaking, any use of material from another source without proper attribution constitutes plagiarism,
regardless why that occurred, and any such conduct violates accepted standards of academic integrity.
• Some students deliberately plagiarize, often rationalizing this misconduct with a variety of excuses: falling
behind and succumbing to the pressures of meeting deadlines; feeling overworked and wishing to reduce their
workloads; compensating for actual (or perceived) academic or language deficiencies; and/or justifying plagiarism
on other grounds.
• But some students commit plagiarism without intending to do so, often stumbling into negligent plagiarism
as a result of sloppy notetaking, insufficient paraphrasing, and/or ineffective proofreading. Those problems,
however, neither justify nor excuse this breach of academic standards. By misunderstanding the meaning of
plagiarism and/or failing to cite sources accurately, you are much more likely to commit this violation. Avoiding that
outcome requires, at a minimum, a clear understanding of plagiarism and the appropriate techniques for scholarly
attribution. (See related information on paraphrasing; notetaking and proofreading; and acknowledging and citing
sources.)
By merely changing a few words or rearranging several words or sentences, you are not paraphrasing. Making
minor revisions to borrowed text amounts to plagiarism.
• Even if properly cited, a "paraphrase" that is too similar to the original source's wording and/or structure is,
in fact, plagiarized. (See additional information on paraphrasing.)
Remember, your instructors should be able to clearly identify which materials (e.g., words and ideas) are your own
and which originated with other sources.
• That cannot be accomplished without proper attribution. You must give credit where it is due,
acknowledging the sources of any borrowed passages, ideas, or other types of materials, and enclosing any
verbatim excerpts with quotation marks (using block indentation for longer passages).
Plagiarism & Unauthorized Collaboration
Plagiarism and unauthorized collaboration are often committed jointly.
12

Faculty name Course—Semester and Year page 13
By submitting as your own work any unattributed material that you obtained from other sources (including the
contributions of another student who assisted you in preparing a homework assignment), you have committed
plagiarism. And if the instructor did not authorize students to work together on the assignment, you have also
engaged in unauthorized collaboration. Both violations contribute to the same fundamental deception—representing
material obtained from another source as your own work.
Group efforts that extend beyond the limits approved by an instructor frequently involve plagiarism in addition to
unauthorized collaboration. For example, an instructor may allow students to work together while researching a
subject, but require each student to write a separate report. If the students collaborate while writing their reports
and then submit the products of those joint efforts as individual works, they are guilty of unauthorized collaboration
as well as plagiarism. In other words, the students collaborated on the written assignment without authorization to
do so, and also failed to acknowledge the other students' contributions to their own individual reports.
Multiple Submissions
Submitting the same paper (or other type of assignment) for two courses without prior approval represents another
form of academic dishonesty.
You may not submit a substantially similar paper or project for credit in two (or more) courses unless expressly
authorized to do so by your instructor(s). (See Section 11-802(b) of the Institutional Rules on Student Services and
Activities for the University's official definition of scholastic dishonesty.)
You may, however, re-work or supplement previous work on a topic with the instructor's approval.
Some students mistakenly assume that they are entitled to submit the same paper (or other assignment) for two (or
more) classes simply because they authored the original work.
Unfortunately, students with this viewpoint tend to overlook the relevant ethical and academic issues, focusing
instead on their own "authorship" of the original material and personal interest in receiving essentially double credit
for a single effort.
Unauthorized multiple submissions are inherently deceptive. After all, an instructor reasonably assumes that any
completed assignments being submitted for credit were actually prepared for that course. Mindful of that
assumption, students who "recycle" their own papers from one course to another make an effort to convey that
impression. For instance, a student may revise the original title page or imply through some other means that he or
she wrote the paper for that particular course, sometimes to the extent of discussing a "proposed" paper topic with
the instructor or presenting a "draft" of the paper before submitting the "recycled" work for credit.
The issue of plagiarism is also relevant. If, for example, you previously prepared a paper for one course and then
submit it for credit in another course without citing the initial work, you are committing plagiarism—essentially "self-
plagiarism"—the term used by some institutions. Recall the broad scope of plagiarism: all types of materials can be
plagiarized, including unpublished works, even papers you previously wrote.
Another problem concerns the resulting "unfair academic advantage" that is specifically referenced in the
University's definition of scholastic dishonesty. If you submit a paper for one course that you prepared and submitted
for another class, you are simply better situated to devote more time and energy toward fulfilling other requirements
for the subsequent course than would be available to classmates who are completing all course requirements during
that semester. In effect, you would be gaining an unfair academic advantage, which constitutes academic
dishonesty as it is defined on this campus.
Some students, of course, do recognize one or more of these ethical issues, but still refrain from citing their
authorship of prior papers to avoid earning reduced (or zero) credit for the same works in other classes. That
underlying motivation further illustrates the deceptive nature of unauthorized multiple submissions.
An additional issue concerns the problematic minimal efforts involved in "recycling" papers (or other prepared
assignments). Exerting minimal effort basically undercuts the curricular objectives associated with a particular
assignment and the course itself. Likewise, the practice of "recycling" papers subverts important learning goals for
individual degree programs and higher education in general, such as the mastery of specific skills that students
should acquire and develop in preparing written assignments. This demanding but necessary process is somewhat
analogous to the required regimen of athletes, like the numerous laps and other repetitive training exercises that
runners must successfully complete to prepare adequately for a marathon.
