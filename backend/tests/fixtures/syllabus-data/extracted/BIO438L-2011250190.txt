Course Synopsis: The objective of the course it to understand animal communication.
To do so, we must become familiar with its physical principles, sensory and
morphological mechanisms, behavioral function, and evolution. The emphasis is on
integrating information from different areas of biology to make this understanding as
general as possible.
The first half of the course will address the general principles of communication
in each sensory modality, while the second half will address various topics concerning
the behavior, ecology, and evolution of communication systems. The laboratory
exercises will emphasize quantitative analysis of signals and experimental studies of
animal communication. The laboratory schedule is below.
Lectures: Tuesday, Thursday 11:00-12:30 PM, RLM 6.112
Labs: Monday or Wednesday 8:00-11:00, Brackenridge Field Lab rm 114 .
UT shuttle (LA route) leaves Whitis and 21st St, by the fountain on the UT campus , at
7:36 AM and arrives at 7:55 AM at BFL. The laboratory will end at 10:30, in time to
catch the 10:35 shuttle, which leaves from in front of BFL, to reach campus by 10:55.

Textbook (recommended): Principles of Animal Communication. J.W. Bradbury & S. L.
Vehrencamp, Sinauer and Associates, Sunderland MA (~$93). There is a new edition of
this book being published in May 2011. Therefore, the publisher is not s elling any copies
of the available edition. There are, however, used numerous copies available on
Amazon.com, as low as $64. A copy is on reserve in the Life Sciences Library (MAI ).
I-Clickers: I-clickers will be used during the lecture portion of the class. These will be
used for short quizzes (graded), and for assessing understanding of the lecture material in
real-time (ungraded). I-clickers can be purchased from the Unive rsity Co-op. There are
used I-clickers available for lower cost. P lease be sure that you purchase the “I-clicker”,
and no t one of the other, available interactive devices. You must register your I -clicker in
Blackboard.
Grading: Half of the grade is based on the lecture portion of the course and half on the
lab. There are two lecture exams, dates are given below. The lecture portion of your
grade is grade is derive d equally for the two exams and from the in-class quizzes and

participation. The final exam is an oral exam. The requirements for the lab and the
independent project are detailed below. The various short lab assignments are worth a
combined 20% of the final grade and the independent project is worth 30% of the final
grade (more details on the independent project below) .
Points are deducted for any assignments handed in late.
Absences: If a student misses the exam they must contact the instructor or TA within 24
hours of the exam and provide of note from a medical doctor in order to take a makeup
exam. If a st udent anticipates missing a lab, they can switch to the other lab for that week
only with prior permission from the TA. If a stud ent has a medical excuse (and note) for
missing a lab, every attempt will be made to have the student make up that lab.
Class Web Site: We will use Blackboard. Lectures will be presented in power point
format and made available on the web. Laboratory material, including the lab exercises,
problem sets, etc., will also be on the web site. You must register your I -clicker in
Blackboard.
Lecture Schedule
Most of the topics addressed will also be covered in the textbook. The textbook,
however, goes into far more detail and covers more topics than possible in a one semester
undergraduate course. For each lecture, I will assign the relative pages to be read in the
textbook and I will distribute an outline of that day’s lecture.

Animal Communication Lab
Place and Time: The lab meets on Monday/Wednesday from 8-11 AM. The labs will be
at Brackenridge Field Station (BFL), located at 2907 Lake Austin Blvd. Lab will end by
10:30 AM to allow you to take the UT Shuttle to be back on campus by 10:55 AM.
Sound Tutorial: There is a Sound Tutorial which is both on the computers at BFL and on
the class website where it can be downloaded. You are required to work through this
tutorial in week 1, in lieu of lab that week. This tutorial will aid both in the first few labs
and in the l ectures on acoustic properties of sound.
Sound Ruler: This is the program we use to analyze sounds. It is on the lab computers
and it can be downloaded free of charge from http://soundruler.sourceforge.net/main/.
Also in lieu of lab in week 1, you should download Sound Ruler from its web site and the
Sound Analysis lab from the website. This lab describes the basic use of Sound Ruler.
You should be familiar with the operati on of Sound Ruler before the lab for week 2.
Field trips: There will be several field trips in addition to the weekly labs. Students will
receive extra credit for attending. These on scheduled on an ad hoc basis due to
constraints of weather.
Introduction: The goal of lab in the first half of the semester is to provide a general
overview of some of the tools use in studies on animal communication. The last half of
the semester is devoted to independent projects. Small groups of students ( usually 2) will
develop projects with the help of the professor and the TA. Students should be
considering potential projects as we are learning different techniques in the first half of
the lab. Although the labs are biased towards acoustic and visual communication, projects
working with other sensory modalities or techniques are welcome.
Attendance at all lab sessions is required, and switching between sessions (Monday
/Wednesday) without previous approval is not allowed. If a student misses a lab they must
contact the TA and provide a note from a medical doctor. (The same is true for exams.)
Students that have missed a lab with a valid excuse will do the lab on their own if
possible or a makeup assignment where the lab is not possible . Attendance during the
presentations of independent projects is obligatory, and everybody must stay to hear all
the presentations.
The la b manuals will be available o n Blackboard. You should read the appropriate
section of the manual before each class in order to know what materials to br ing, and to
be familiar with objectives of that day.
You will need an EID account for using the computers during the lab. You were assigned
one of these accounts when you entered UT, be sure that you remember your username
3

and password. If you need help with the information of your account contact the
Biological Sciences Computer Support Facility at help@bscsf.utexas.edu
Equipment Check-Out Procedure: Send an email to the TA specifying what you need,
and when you want to use it. The TA will email you back and telling you when you can
get the equipment. Since the equipment is stored at the lab in BFL it is best to get
equipment while you are out there or lab. The equipment is limited and some can be in
short supply, especially by the end of the semester. So plan ahead and reserve the
equipment in advance if you need to use it on specific days. Check out time will depend
on how many people are working with it.
Independent project : The project should be on animal communication. In general, we
discourage projects on pets and humans (as well as pet humans). Your independent
project is your opportunity to expand your interest in particular aspects of the class. The
projects will be developed individually or in small groups (no more than 2 students).
With the help of the professor and the TA you will build a research plan achievable
during the second half of the semester. Students may not use the independent study for
another course. Graduate students may not c onduct independent studies that will be part
of their thesis project.
Grade: Lab reports sum up to the 20% of the final grade.
Your independent project is 30% of your final grade for the class. The grade for your
project includes your performance on the presentations (3) and your final paper (see
below).
Attendance during the presentations of independent projects is obligatory, and everybody
must stay for all presentations.
For the presentations, you will use Power Point.
Proposal Topic: You should discuss your idea of a proposal with the TA and/or the
professor. The TA must approve your topic for the proposal and you must give her a
short written explanation of your idea (< 1 p) by week 7 (Mon: Feb 28/Wed: March 2).
Save the written proposal topic as it will need to be handed i n with the final project.
We strongly suggest you begin thinking about the project immediately and do not wait
until the last week to the proposal topic approved. Anyone wishing to work with vertebrates
must get permission as early as possible and adhere to animal care (IACUC) policies.
Project proposal: Week 9, March 21/23. Power Point presentation, 10 min max. Give an
introduction to the topic you chose for your project, present your question, and explain
why this is a relevant study in animal communication. The background information you
give should be relevant to frame your question and/or predictions. T hen, state the
methodology that you will use. Be specific, give details about your protocol and include
4

the sample size that you are planning to achieve. Save the power point presentation as it
will need to be handed it with the final project.
Preliminary results: Week 12, April 11/13. Presentation, 10 min max. A full introduction
is not necessary for this presentation , just briefly remind us of your question and your
methods. At this point you need to present sufficient data to demonstrate that the projec t
is tractable. If you are having problems with the project (i.e. the animals you were
planning to study are not as responsive as you thought they would be), mention these
difficulties and also try to suggest solutions. If your project is proving intractab le, meet
with the TA or professor before the presentation about changing the project, and present
the proposal of your new project instead of the preliminary results. Save the power point
presentation as it will need to be handed it with the final project.
Final Presentation: Week 15, May 2/4. Presentation: a 15 min max power point
presentation and a paper is due the day of your presentation. Give a full presentation of
your project including introduction, methods, results and discussion.
For the final project you must submit the following : (i) the written paper ; (ii) On a CD:
(a) the proposal topic document, (b) the written paper (thus you submit both a hard copy
and a digital copy of the final paper ), and (c) the three power point presentations: project
proposal, preliminary results and final presentation.
Some hints for your presentations:
Do not present big tables with small letter. Try to present your data in graphs.
Include pictures, diagrams and sounds that can help you explain your point.
Try to avoid slides with full text in small letter. Summarize your ideas in short
phrases that the audience can easily follow.
Relate your findings to the general introduction you presented in the initial
proposal.
