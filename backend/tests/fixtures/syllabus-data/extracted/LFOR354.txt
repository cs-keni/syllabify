Scope of Material
CH 354 covers the subject of quantum mechanics from a chemist’s point of view. The
course will begin with a “review” of concepts from mathematics (trigonometry and calculus,
primarily)thatareseenagainandagaininthiscourse,followedbyahistoricaloverviewofthe
subject,coveringphysicsfromthetimeofNewtontothedawnofthenewageatthebeginning
ofthe20th century. Thisisfollowedbyanoutlineoftheframeworkofquantummechanicsand
its application to model systems for which the Schr¨odinger equation can be solved exactly.
In chemistry, however, all systems of interest involve mathematically intractable Schro¨dinger
equationsandapproximationsarethenameofthegame. Therestofthecoursedealswiththe
fundamental principles that underlie atoms and molecules: the existence of discrete energy
levels, their qualitative interpretation, and the ability of electromagnetic radiation (photons)
to induce transitions between these levelsi and the connection between quantum mechanics
and thermodynamics. I will warn you now that this course (particularly the early part of it)
involves some rather serious and involved mathematics. If you were overwhelmed with the
math encountered in CH 353, you might seriously consider re-evaluating your decision to
take this course. Also, this course is not a requirement for any degree at UT, so anyone who
is in this class is here by choice. It’s tough, but worth it for those who expend the effort.
Homework
Homework problems will be assigned every other Tuesday throughout the semester and are
due at the beginning of class two weeks later. Assignments turned in later than 5:00 PM
on the specified Tuesday will not be accepted. If you anticipate that it will not be possible
to arrive by that time, there are two options: 1) get a friend to turn it in for you; 2) slide
your homework under my office door sometime BEFORE 5:00 PM on Tuesday afternoon.
Please show all work on the sheets provided in the homework packet. If there is not enough
room underneath the problem statement to write down your calculations and/or reasoning
along with the solution, you should attach extra pages to the assignment packet, order them
properly and then restaple it before submission. For those of you who want challenging and
sometimes algebraically brutal problems, I will not disappoint.
Examinations
There will be three open-book, open-note examinations administered during the usual class
time, and the course will conclude with a comprehensive final examination. I expect you
to be responsible and avoid scheduling conflicts that interfere with exams. Take note of the
exam dates now and plan things such as medical school interviews accordingly. I rarely
give make-up exams, and do so only for very good reasons (medical emergencies, death of a
relative, religious holidays etc.).

The Dean Sez...
The Dean’s office has requested that the following information be included in the syllabus:
• Please notify me of any modification/adaptation you may require to accommodate a
disability-related need. You will be requested to provide documentation to the Dean of
Students’ Office, in order that the most appropriate accomodations can be determined. Spe-
cialized services are available on campus through Services for Students with Disabilities.
• Students unable to take examinations that are given on a religious holiday must notify the
instructor (me) at least fourteen days in advance.
Grading Policy
The basis for grades in CH 354 will be performance on the hour exams, the final exam and
the homework assignments. Only the five highest of seven homework scores will be counted.
The distribution of points is given below. In general, the basis for grade assignment is the
class median; those of you scoring above the median receive a grade of A or B; those scoring
below receive a C, D or F. While I generally do not give a lot of A’s, it works both ways:
only the truly determined student can get an F in this class.
