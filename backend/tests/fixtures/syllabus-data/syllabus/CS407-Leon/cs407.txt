Grading Policies
Grading will be based on the following criteria:

To pass this seminar, students are expected to submit all required deliverables and attend all seminar meetings in person.  Attendance will be taken during the first 5 minutes of each seminar meeting.  Missing more than one seminar meeting (after week 1) due to unexcused absence will result in failure of the seminar.  Absences will only be excused in accordance with the University Course Attendance and Engagement policy.  Please contact me to arrange a makeup assignment If you absolutely need to miss more than one seminar meeting (after week 1) due to unexcused absences (including illness).

AI Policy
Students may use GenAI tools in this class to help with course work and assignments. Helpful uses include brainstorming ideas, creating outlines, editing, and so forth.  Although open use of GenAI is allowed in this class, be advised that GenAI suggestions or content can be inaccurate, incomplete or otherwise problematic; using GenAI can impact negatively the quality of your work and your grades.

Classroom Community Expectations
All members of the class (both students and instructor) can expect to:

Participate and Contribute:  All students are expected to participate by sharing ideas and contributing to the learning environment. This entails preparing, following instructions, and engaging respectfully and thoughtfully with others.   While all students should participate, participation is not just talking, and a range of participation activities support learning. Participation might look like speaking aloud in the full class and in small groups as well as submitting questions prior to class or engaging with the message board.  We will establish more specific participation guidelines and criteria for contributions in our first weeks of the term.

Expect and Respect Diversity: All classes at the University of Oregon welcome and respect diverse experiences, perspectives, and approaches. What is not welcome are behaviors or contributions that undermine, demean, or marginalize others based on race, ethnicity, gender, sex, age, sexual orientation, religion, ability, or socioeconomic status. We will value differences and communicate disagreements with respect. We may establish more specific guidelines and protocols to ensure inclusion and equity for all members of our learning community.

Help Everyone Learn: Part of how we learn together is by learning from one another. To do this effectively, we need to be patient with each other, identify ways we can assist others, and be open-minded to receiving help and feedback from others. Don’t hesitate to contact me to ask for assistance or offer suggestions that might help us learn better.
