Course Description

Tennis is one of the most popular sports in the world. Together we will learn about and play Tennis, and have a good time doing it! I look forward to sharing a great experience with everyone as we learn, grow, and explore the different aspects of the game and ourselves as a community from a beginner's perspective. There's a lot we have to learn from each other and Tennis is an excellent way to relax and share what we have to offer. Let's enjoy it!

*Course Deadlines & Late Work

 

Student Intro Survey –   DUE: Week 1

My goal is to create an environment where you are confident that you belong and where you can meet your own learning and wellness goals. I also prioritize your safety and the safety of your peers. To create an environment where all students belong, and where you can meet your goals safely, it is helpful to know more about you as a person.

Complete this survey on Canvas. It is not an assessment of you--if you share what you are comfortable and interested in sharing, you will receive automatic credit. Your responses are fully confidential. If you choose not to respond to a specific question, please make a note such as N/A (not applicable).

QUIZ - Week 8

Writing Assignment -     DUE: Week 10

One page typed single spaced paper about Tennis. See Assignment on Canvas for details. 

Reflection Paper –          DUE: Week 10 

One page typed single spaced class/self-reflection – What did you learn? What was most helpful to you? What did you most enjoy? What was most challenging? ..etc 

This does not need to be a full page, but please answer as thoroughly as possible. Thank you.

 

Generative Artificial Intelligence Use

Students may not use GenAI tools in this course to produce course materials or assignments in whole or in part. All work you submit for this course toward completion of course requirements must be your own original work done specifically for this course and without substantive assistance from others, including GenAI. Work you’ve completed for previous courses or are developing for other courses this term also should not be submitted for this course.  In accordance with UO policy, if I believe you’ve handed in work created all or in part by GenAI, I will submit a report of suspected academic misconduct to the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards for that office to make a determination of responsibility and, if warranted, assess a grade penalty. If you have any questions or doubts, please ask!

General Physical Education Information

Access and Accommodations
The University of Oregon and I are dedicated to fostering inclusive, equitable, and accessible learning environments for all students. Students of all abilities are welcome in PE classes. The Accessible Education Center (AEC) assists students with disabilities in reducing barriers in the educational experience. You may be eligible for accommodations for a variety of disabilities – apparent disabilities, such as a mobility or physical disability, or non apparent disabilities, such as chronic illnesses or psychological disabilities. If you have or think you have a disability and experience academic barriers, please contact the Accessible Education Center (Location: 360 Oregon Hall; 541-346-1155; uoaec@uoregon.edu) to discuss appropriate accommodations or support. The details of your disability will be kept confidential with the AEC and you are not expected to share this information with others. However, I invite you to discuss any approved accommodations or access needs at any time with me.

Inclement Weather or Campus Emergency

It is generally expected that class will meet unless the University is officially closed. In the event of a campus emergency that disrupts academic activities, course requirements, deadlines, and grading percentages are subject to change. Information about changes in this course will be communicated as soon as possible on Canvas. If we are not able to meet face-to-face, students should immediately log onto Canvas and read any announcements and/or access alternative assignments. Students are also expected to continue coursework as outlined in this syllabus or other instructions on Canvas. Updates on inclement weather and closure are also communicated as described on the Inclement Weather webpage. 

A Message About Moderation

The instructors in the Department of Physical Education and Recreation care about your health and well-being.  We want to send a clear message to you that when it comes to exercise, MORE IS NOT ALWAYS BETTER!  Moderation, variety, and balance are important and often neglected components of fitness.  Consider balancing your cardiovascular training with strength, flexibility, and mind-body work.  Excessive exercise can lead to injury, metabolic suppression, and can even be a symptom of disordered eating.  Are you concerned you may be exercising excessively?  If so, please discuss this with your instructor, or consult with a professional at University Counseling Services (appointments at 346-3227). 

 

Mandatory Reporting

I am a designated reporter. For information about my reporting obligations as an employee, please see Employee Reporting Obligations on the Office of Investigations and Civil Rights Compliance (OICRC) website. Students experiencing sex- or gender-based discrimination, harassment or violence should call the 24-7 hotline 541-346-SAFE [7244] or visit safe.uoregon.edu for help. Students experiencing all forms of prohibited discrimination or harassment may contact the Dean of Students Office at 541-346-3216 or the non-confidential Title IX Coordinator/OICRC at 541-346-3123 to request information and resources. Students are not required to participate in an investigation to receive support, including requesting academic supportive measures. Additional resources are available at investigations.uoregon.edu/how-get-support.

I am also a mandatory reporter of child abuse. Please find more information at Mandatory Reporting of Child Abuse and Neglect.

Pregnancy Modifications

Pregnant and parenting students are eligible for academic and work modifications related to pregnancy, childbirth, loss of pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, lactation, and related medical conditions. To request pregnancy-related modifications, students should complete the Request for Pregnancy Modifications formLinks to an external site. on the OICRC website. OICRC coordinates academic and other modifications for pregnant and parenting students to ensure students can continue to access their education and university programs and activities.

 

Student Conduct Code & Academic Integrity

All students are expected to abide by UO’s Student Code of Conduct. I will report all suspected misconduct to the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards. If the Office finds a student has committed misconduct, consequences can include failure of the relevant assignment or exam, or of the course.

 

If at any point in the term you are unsure about whether a behavior aligns with academic integrity in our course, please contact me. I view student questions about academic integrity as a desire to act with integrity, so I welcome your questions.

 

Community

We recognize, understand and encourage celebration of the human differences that surround us.  We ask you to participate in fostering this spirit. Expressions of bigotry, hatred, prejudice, or disrespect are inconsistent with the ideals of preserving human dignity and contradict the values of healthful living and fair play promoted by PE & Rec and our staff. 

 

Basic Needs

Being able to meet your basic needs is foundational to your success as a student at the University of Oregon. If you are having difficulty affording food, don’t have a stable, safe place to live, or are struggling to meet another need, visit the UO Basic Needs Resource page for information on how to get support. They have information food, housing, healthcare, childcare, transportation, technology, finances (including emergency funds), and legal support. 

If your need is urgent, please contact the Care and Advocacy Program by calling 541-346-3216, filling out the Community Care and Support formLinks to an external site., or by scheduling an appointmentLinks to an external site. with an advocate. 

 

Your Well-being

Life at college can be very complicated. Students often feel overwhelmed or stressed, experience anxiety or depression, struggle with relationships, or just need help navigating challenges in their life. If you're facing such challenges, you don't need to handle them on your own--there's help and support on campus.  

 

As your instructor if I believe you may need additional support, I will express my concerns, the reasons for them, and refer you to resources that might be helpful. It is not my intention to know the details of what might be bothering you, but simply to let you know I care and that help is available. Getting help is a courageous thing to do—for yourself and those you care about. 

 

University Health Services helps students cope with difficult emotions and life stressors. If you need general resources on coping with stress or want to talk with another student who has been in the same place as you, schedule an appointment with a student Well-being Coach or visit the Duck Nest (located in the EMU on the ground floor) and get help from one of the specially trained Peer Wellness Advocates.  

 

University Counseling Services (UCS) has a team of dedicated staff members to support you with your concerns, many of whom can provide identity-based support. All clinical services are free and confidential. Find out more at counseling.uoregon.edu or by calling 541-346-3227 (anytime UCS is closed, the After-Hours Support and Crisis Line is available by calling this same number).
