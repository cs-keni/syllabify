CS 313 (Fall 2025; 11583) Interm Data Structures
Jump to Today
Course Title: Intermediate Data Structures
Course Number: CS 313
Course Description
Our main theme is the equation (proposed by Niklas Wirth) "Programs=Algorithms + Data Structures." First, we will review the asymptotic complexity notations, loop invariants and recurrence equations, as well as the basic linear data structures. Then, we will discuss rooted ordered trees and their usage, especially as search structures (i.e., Binary Search Trees, Red-Black Trees). We will conclude with some basic sorting algorithms and some analysis using the newly introduced data structures. The objective of the course is to acquire facility using tools to analyze (and design!) algorithms (computational complexity, proofs of correctness) and structuring the information manipulated by the algorithms.

Expected Learning Outcomes
This course develops basic concepts and applications of data structures in computer science. The primary topics are familiarity with asymptotic complexity notations, loop invariants, recurrence equations, analysis of basic linear data structures along with their applications to computational problems, rooted ordered trees and their usage and analysis for basic operations of data structures: searches, additions, deletions, and basic sorting algorithms along with their analysis using the newly introduced data structures.

Upon successful completion of the course, students will be able to:

demonstrate facility with asymptotic complexity notations, common functions and their asymptotic relations;
demonstrate the ability to use asymptotic complexity notations and common functions to measure the complexity of basic algorithms (loops, recurrence, searches, additions, deletions);
demonstrate facility using loop invariants to prove the correctness of loop functions;
demonstrate facility with basic operations in linear data structures (stacks, queues, priority queues), their complexity, and their applications to some basic problems (expression evaluation, tree traversal);
demonstrate facility with heaps (binary and binomial), procedures for basic operations (searches, additions, deletions) and their complexity;
demonstrate facility with hash tables and basic hash functions;
demonstrate facility with self-balancing trees (AVL, 2-3-4, and Red-Black trees), procedures for basic operations, and their complexity;
demonstrate facility with basic sorting algorithms, their procedures, and their complexity; and
demonstrate the ability to use the introduced data structures to develop efficient algorithms for some basic problems and compute the complexity for those algorithms.
Acquired Skills
Upon successful completion of the course, students will have acquired the following essential skills:

be able to implement the introduced data structures and their operations using a programming language (e.g., Python);
be able to design efficient algorithms for some basic problems in computer science using the introduced data structures, and implement them using a programming language;
be able to run the implemented programs in computers and debug the programs if necessary.

Course Policies
Late Work
All assignments are due by 11:59 pm of the stated due date. Please submit your assignments on Canvas. Assignments will be accepted for up to two days past the due date with a penalty of 10% per (calendar) day.

Barriers and Accommodations
Our goal is a fully inclusive class, accessible to everyone. If you encounter or anticipate barriers to full participation and fair evaluation for any reason, please communicate your needs to the instructor so that we can find a suitable accommodation. If you encounter or observe other impediments to full participation, for yourself or others, please share your concerns with the instructor. You are also encouraged to contact the Accessible Education Center.

It is particularly important that you inform the instructor in the first week of the quarter if you require accommodation. Delayed notification of such a requirement may make it impossible to provide the accommodation.

Academic Honesty
The University Student Conduct Code (available at /courses/274725/file_contents/course%20files/conduct.uoregon.edu) defines academic misconduct. Students are prohibited from committing or attempting to commit any act that constitutes academic misconduct. Students should properly acknowledge and document all sources of information (e.g., quotations, paraphrases, ideas) and use only the sources and resources authorized by the instructor. If there is any question about whether an act constitutes academic misconduct, it is the student’s obligation to clarify the question with the instructor before committing to attempting to commit the act.

All projects turned in for the course must be your own work. Copying from other class members or other sources is not acceptable. If you collaborate with someone else on an assignment, you must indicate such on the work you turn in. Collaboration that is not explicitly credited is plagiarism.

Academic honesty is expected and cases of suspected dishonesty will be handled according to university policy. In particular, copying someone else's work (including material found on the web) will not be tolerated. If solutions to assignments are obtained from outside sources, the source must be cited.

You are also responsible for protecting your work. That is, you must take reasonable precautions to prevent your work from being copied. This means that if you store your assignment solutions on a shared server, the file permissions must be set to keep others from accessing your files. If you are working on assignments in the lab, you must remove any of your files from the lab machine before you leave.

Turning in someone else's code is collusion, and is a particularly heinous form of plagiarism; if collusion is detected, all individuals involved (i.e., the copyee and all copyers) will be given a grade of F in the course.

Generative AI (GenAI) Policy
Students may not use GenAI tools in this course to produce course materials or assignments in whole or in part. All work you submit for this course toward completion of course requirements must be your own original work done specifically for this course and without substantive assistance from others, including GenAI. Work you’ve completed for previous courses or are developing for other courses this term also should not be submitted for this course.  In accordance with UO policy, if I believe you’ve handed in work created all or in part by GenAI, I will submit a report of suspected academic misconduct to the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards for that office to make a determination of responsibility. If you have any questions or doubts, please ask!

Academic Disruption due to Campus Emergency
In the event of a campus emergency that disrupts academic activities, course requirements, deadlines, and grading percentages are subject to change. Information about changes in this course will be communicated as soon as possible by email and on Canvas. If we are not able to meet face-to-face, students should immediately log onto Canvas and read any announcements and./or access alternative assignments. Students are also encouraged to continue the readings and other assignments as outlined in this syllabus or subsequent versions of the syllabus.

Prohibited Discrimination and Harassment Reporting
I am a designated reporter. For information about my reporting obligations as an employee, please see Employee Reporting Obligations on the Office of Investigations and Civil Rights Compliance (OICRC) website. Students experiencing sex- or gender-based discrimination, harassment or violence should call the 24-7 hotline 541-346-SAFE [7244] or visit safe.uoregon.edu for help. Students experiencing all forms of prohibited discrimination or harassment may contact the Dean of Students Office at 541-346-3216 or the non-confidential Title IX Coordinator/OICRC at 541-346-3123 to request information and resources. Students are not required to participate in an investigation to receive support, including requesting academic supportive measures. Additional resources are available at investigations.uoregon.edu/how-get-support.

I am also a mandatory reporter of child abuse. Please find more information at Mandatory Reporting of Child Abuse and Neglect.

Pregnancy Modifications. Pregnant and parenting students are eligible for academic and work modifications related to pregnancy, childbirth, loss of pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, lactation, and related medical conditions. To request pregnancy-related modifications, students should complete the Request for Pregnancy Modifications formLinks to an external site. on the OICRC website. OICRC coordinates academic and other modifications for pregnant and parenting students to ensure students can continue to access their education and university programs and activities.
