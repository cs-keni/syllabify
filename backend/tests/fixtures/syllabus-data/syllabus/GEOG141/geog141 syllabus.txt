GEs and Lab Sections

Labs are graded and monitored by GEs. Your amazing lab GE is assigned by the last two letters of your last name. For example, if your last name begins with "Ab", then your lab GE is Troy. Communicate with them with questions or help with your labs.

Course Objectives

We will use readings, labs, discussions, and other materials to develop an understanding and appreciation of natural processes that occur on Earth every day. This will be an overview of the basics on topics of meteorology (study of the atmosphere and weather), climatology (longer-term trends in weather and its variation over the earth), biogeography (distribution of life on earth), and geomorphology (processes that shape the surface of the earth).

Students will also understand the important properties of maps as students will use maps and digital mapping tools to explore spatial patterns on earth.

Topics in meteorology will range from why weather changes daily and learn how to interpret various weather elements (temperature, air pressure, humidity, wind).

In climatology, students will study the causes of seasonal patterns of temperature and rainfall in different locations on earth. Students will be able to link the causes of these seasonal patterns to patterns in atmospheric circulation, and the role of various other factors such as elevation and location within continents. Lastly, students will be able to roughly locate climatic data from actual locations on earth.

In biogeography, students will be able to explain why climates produce major biome types on earth, with emphasis on biotic variability of Oregon (spoiler: we have a bit of everything here!).

In geomorphology and related geologic topics students will gain an understanding of major earth-forming processes (plate tectonics, volcanism, mountain orogeny), as well as of surface processes (weathering, mass wasting, erosion, deposition) and various landform types. Deep-time topics will include fossilization, evolution, and biotic radiation. Students will also understand the pathways of water from precipitation to ocean and atmosphere (water cycle), and how rivers sculpt the surface of the earth. Students will be able to identify mass-wasting and glacial features from topographic maps, and be able to create and explain the patterns in longitudinal profiles of rivers.

Course format
Given the unique nature of remote learning, the course format has been modified to allow for maximum flexibility and as much one-on-one interaction as you would need. All your assignments and readings are organized and available through 'Modules'. Although the class is asynchronous, there are still due times for work, so check what is expected for the week and pace yourself accordingly.

Required materials

Chapter readings. These are available to you via Canvas
Laboratory Instructions. These are available to you via Canvas.
Google Earth Pro on desktop (free software). Click this linkLinks to an external site. to download it off of the Google Earth site.   Do not just use Google Earth on web or mobile, as there are features on the desktop app that aren't available on the online version.
Additional and supplementary materials will be made available on canvas.uoregon.edu.
Grading

Late work policy: late work is accepted with an automatic deduction of 20% per day the assignment is late.

Discussions and assignments (20% of total), Two exams (40% of total), and weekly labs and quizzes (40% of total). You must receive a passing grade in lab in order to pass the class.

The final grade scale is as follows: A+: >98; A: 92-98; A-: 90-92; B+: 88-90; B: 82-88; B-: 80-82; C+: 78-80; C: 72-78; C-: 70-72%; D+: 68-70; D: 62-68; D-: 60-62; F: <60.

Grades will be posted on Canvas along with any announcements. I reserve the right to offer extra credit, but you should not expect it or ask for it. If you have questions about your overall grade(s), please make an appointment with me or with your GE to discuss your concerns. PLEASE DO NOT EMAIL ME ASKING TO ROUND UP GRADES. It’s unfair to your classmates, your GEs, and me. Requests to do so will be disregarded.

Discussions and Assignments (20% of total grade)
There will be 5 assignments (10%) and 3 discussions (10%). The assignments are kept simple and usually involve watching a video or series of videos and answering a few questions. Discussions will involve a post and response, typically due four days after they are assigned. You are given ample time to complete and submit assignments, so don't be tempted to put them off to the last minute.


Exams (40% of total grade)
There will be two exams, the midterm (20%) and the final (20%). The midterm will test you on materials from the first five weeks of class (Weeks 1-5), and the final will not be cumulative, i.e. it will only test you on materials after the midterm (Weeks 6-10). Students who miss a test without a documented excuse will receive a score of ZERO for that test.

Makeups for missed exams will require a documented excuse (medical, emergency, etc.). Except in the case of true emergencies, you must contact me prior to the exam if you are going to miss it; otherwise you will receive a grade of zero. Exams will be administered through Canvas and will be open for 12 hours. You can take the exam anytime within that timeframe, but only over a 1 hour 30 minute period. Once you start the exam, you can’t stop. You may use any readings and notes for the exam. If you have any issues with connectivity during the exam, contact me immediately.

Labs and quizzes (40% of total grade)
The weekly labs are a major part of this course. Each week, you will complete two tasks that make up your weekly lab grade. The first is the “lab” and the other is a “quiz”.

   Lab: You can only submit the lab once, but you can leave it open until you are ready to submit

   Quiz: You are given 3 attempts to take the quiz. Only the highest grade will be automatically kept.

The combined lab and quiz are worth 50% of your total weekly lab grade. There are nine lab weeks, but we will drop your lowest-scoring quiz and lab before calculating the total lab grades. If your average grade for the labs (after dropping the lowest lab grade) is not a passing grade (>60%), you will not pass the course. The labs provide you with an opportunity to apply some of the concepts you learn in the materials and readings, and to ask questions about topics that interest or confuse you. Labs begin week 1.

Labs and quizzes are due by no later than 11:59pm Sundays. You have a week to do these, so extensions will not be given unless there is a specific and verifiable reason for turning in late work. Make sure you pace yourself with the tasks and materials and don't try to do them at the last minute.

Contacting me
I am available via email and by request on Zoom and I will respond as soon as I can. If you are located in Eugene, we can meet in person if you would prefer that. If you email me, then please use my actual email address of csaban@uoregon.edu.

Academic Integrity
All students are expected to complete assignments in a manner consistent with academic integrity. Cheating will not be tolerated and will result in serious consequences if it occurs, including expulsion from class. This includes the use of Chat GPT or similar AI. Students must produce their own work and properly acknowledge and document all sources (ideas, quotations, paraphrases). Students can find more complete information about the University of Oregon's Policy on Academic Dishonesty in the University of Oregon Student Handbook or http://integrity.uoregon.edu/. If you find yourself in doubt, in trouble, or if you are aware of academic dishonesty occurring, please talk to one of the instructors.

Accessible Education
It is important to me that everyone has equal opportunity to excel in this course. If you need any specific accommodations in order to participate fully, please inform me of your particular needs, along with documentation from the Accessible Education Center. If accommodations need to be made for exams or lectures, you must inform me at least 1 week prior to the scheduled exam or lab period, after establishing accommodations with an AEC advisor. Please see the Accessible Education Center (www.aec.uoregon.edu) for specific guidelines.

Because this is online only, the AEC testing center will not be operational and the office will operate remotely. If you are registered with AEC, they will inform me of your needs for test taking and I will adjust how long the test is available to you via Canvas.

Note: I consider this syllabus a contract between myself and the students in this course. In writing this syllabus, I have obligated myself to follow the policies and procedures contained herein. You are responsible for understanding and following these policies as well. I reserve the right to make changes to this syllabus. You will receive verbal and written notification of major changes to course policies, procedures and content. To receive credit for taking time to read and understand the contents of this syllabus, please go to "Syllabus sig" in the Week 1 module and sign your name with a friendly greeting.
