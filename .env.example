# Environment variable template. Copy to .env and fill values.
# Used by Flask (backend), Docker Compose. Never commit .env.

# For production: backend runs on Render (env set in Render Dashboard);
# frontend runs on Vercel — set VITE_API_URL in Vercel (see docs/DEPLOYMENT.md).

# Share in Discord for security
# (as in, don't type out the values in Discord, share them over a secure channel, just share how you got your .env values)

# Create frontend/.env.local with:
# VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
# Production: set VITE_API_URL=https://your-app.onrender.com in Vercel Environment Variables.
